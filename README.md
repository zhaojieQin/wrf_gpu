# wrf_gpu

**A GPU-native, WRF-compatible regional weather model.** `wrf_gpu` runs a
standalone WRF v4 ARW forecast end-to-end on a single GPU: it reads a standard
WRF `namelist.input`, assembles its own initial/boundary state from `met_em`
forcing (no `real.exe`, no CPU-WRF dependency), integrates a nonhydrostatic
split-explicit ARW dycore on the GPU, and writes a WRF-compatible `wrfout`
history file.

It is **not** a port of legacy WRF Fortran. It is a clean JAX rewrite that
targets the GPU memory hierarchy from day one and validates against WRF as an
**oracle** — proving cell-for-cell identity to CPU-WRF v4 rather than inheriting
WRF's architecture. The dynamical core runs in **fp64** (around the
pressure-gradient / buoyancy cancellation). The original operational target is
**Canary Islands daily forecasting** (3 km then 1 km) on a single-workstation
RTX 5090 — but its real strength is at the **opposite end of the spectrum: large
grids, big fp64-native GPU systems, and GPU clusters** (B200 / GB300 /
NVL72-class).

### What it is good for

- **Running real regional ARW forecasts on a GPU** from a standard WRF namelist —
  single-domain or live-nested (d01→d02→d03, down to the 1 km nest), with native
  init, restart, and a WRF-compatible `wrfout`.
- **Energy efficiency + modern-HPC fit (PROJECTED).** Past a certain level of
  parallelism, GPUs are inherently more energy-efficient per unit compute than
  CPUs. For serious/large workloads this rewrite is **projected** to run at
  **>3× the energy efficiency** of the CPU stack, to scale with GPU size, and to
  ride the trend of ever-faster, cheaper GPU compute — per kWh and per dollar.
  *(Projected from the device-bound kernel + architecture; not yet benchmarked at scale.)*
- **Capability the CPU stack cannot reach on one box.** **MEASURED:** a **1 km
  single domain fits one RTX 5090 bit-identically**, and the **all-7-island 1 km
  nested case runs end-to-end on one card**. **PROJECTED:** large single grids and
  **cluster / multi-GPU weak-scaling** — the throughput path (memory arithmetic +
  fake-mesh bit-identity proven; real multi-GPU throughput **not yet benchmarked**).
- **A transparent, forkable research artifact.** Every claim has a proof object on
  disk; every architecture decision has a cross-model-reviewed ADR. It is built to
  be driven and extended by an AI manager agent (see [Use the manager](#use-the-manager-agent-driven-development)).

### What it is NOT

- **Not a universal WRF v4.** It covers the common operational ARW subset
  (the wired physics menu below); every unsupported namelist option **fails closed
  before any compute** with a named reason — it never silently substitutes a scheme.
- **Not proven for full 24 h/72 h forecast-skill equivalence.** The
  dynamics/thermodynamics core is proven **cell-for-cell identical** to CPU-WRF;
  the broader T2/U10/V10 forecast-skill equivalence is the **open credibility gate**
  (see [Boundaries](#boundaries--what-is-not-claimed)).
- **Not a blanket single-card speedup story.** On tiny standalone geometries the
  GPU can still be launch/occupancy-bound — on a single-domain 129² grid it is
  **~2.3× SLOWER** than 24-rank CPU-WRF (host/launch-bound). There are several measures to increase tiny grid perfromance implement as shown in the [User's Guide](https://wrf-gpu.github.io/wrf_gpu/). The GPU advantage
  **grows with scale**: the v0.20.0 all-7-island 1 km nested identity test and benchmark is still
  **~1.53× faster on a RTX5090 (terrible card for fp64 actually) than the same-box 12-rank CPU-WRF baseline**. The broader value remains **large grid capability**, **fidelity**,
  **stability/reliability**, and **energy efficiency** (see [Performance](#performance)).
- **Not** DFI / FDDA / spectral-nudging / WRF-Chem / WRF-Fire / urban / lake. (See [port-completion roadmap](docs/PORT_COMPLETION_ROADMAP.md) and [**feature request**](https://github.com/wrf-gpu/wrf_gpu/issues/new?template=feature_request.yml) ) 

**Current release — v0.23.2** (batched-ensemble distinct-init CLI fix, on top of the v0.23.1 usability + AI-native onboarding line): a full
[User's Guide](https://wrf-gpu.github.io/wrf_gpu/), an [AI operator skill](AI_OPERATOR.md) so an agent can run a
case for you, and backward-compatible **WRF-parity CLI ergonomics** (forecast length and root
domain default from `namelist.input`; a `namelist-support` subcommand; a `--dry-run` preflight).
It changes **no dynamics, no physics, no default numerical result** — numerically identical to
**v0.23.0**, the performance base, whose headline is an opt-in **batched ensemble**
(`GPUWRF_BATCH_ENSEMBLE=B`) that fills the otherwise-idle small-grid GPU (a Tenerife 3&nbsp;km&rarr;1&nbsp;km
nest reaches ~97&nbsp;% of the large-grid throughput ceiling at B=4). Priority order, always:
**stability > identity > speed > memory**; no masking or clamps; the open 24&ndash;72&nbsp;h
forecast-skill gate is not claimed closed.

Operational detail (the one-time cold compile, the seconds-fast warm-start cache, the opt-in fp32
mode, VRAM sizing) now lives in the **[User's Guide](https://wrf-gpu.github.io/wrf_gpu/)**. The full,
release-by-release history is the [Version history](#version-history) table below &mdash; each row
links its complete notes in [`release_notes/`](release_notes/).

## WRF-v4 identity — proven cell-for-cell against CPU-WRF v4

`wrf_gpu` is validated by a **reproducible, CPU-only identity-proof system**: it
compares a GPU `wrfout` against a CPU-WRF `wrfout` from the same init, over **all
grid cells, all 72 forecast leads, and all core prognostic variables**, against a
**frozen tolerance manifest** (read before comparison, never tuned). This
**cell-identity** method is the project's primary fidelity gate — a per-cell,
per-lead, per-variable proof, not an aggregate station-RMSE summary. Full method +
reproduce commands: **[docs/IDENTITY_PROOF.md](docs/IDENTITY_PROOF.md)**.

The result is **9 of 10 hard-gate fields within frozen tolerance with the full
dynamics/thermodynamics core cell-for-cell identical** (`r ≈ 0.99–1.00`). The one
out-of-envelope field is a **bounded diagnostic, drawn red, never painted green**:
accumulated precipitation `RAINNC`, which stays inside a bounded multiple of a
tight 1.0 mm bound (see the framing below the plots).

**The v0.18 default Thompson microphysics is strictly more WRF-faithful than
v0.17.** v0.18 adds Thompson cold-process fidelity (rci/sci cloud-ice collection,
cloud-water freezing, graupel-number diagnostics) and, during the v0.18 release
gate, fixed a warm-process regression that the cold-process work had introduced:
WRF's sparse-graupel melt-intercept override (`module_mp_thompson.F:2802-2806`) is
now transcribed verbatim, and the rci/sci ice-collection family is gated on WRF's
cold block `T < T_0` (`module_mp_thompson.F:2554`). Against the WRF mass oracle the
warm-process `qr`/`qg` errors drop by ~3–4 orders of magnitude vs both v0.17 and
the intermediate trunk; cell-level `qv` error reaches **1.2×10⁻¹³ (bit-exact
WRF)**. Proof: `proofs/v018/integration_report.md` (F1 closeout),
`proofs/v018/thompson_process_oracle.json`.

**Switzerland d01 — 72 h, v0.18 (9/10, dynamics/thermo cell-for-cell):**
![GPU↔CPU identity proof — Switzerland d01 72 h (v0.18)](docs/assets/v018/identity_proof/switzerland_d01/identity_dashboard.png)

This dashboard is built from the **retained v0.18 72 h GPU run**
(`v018_rainnc_qvapor_switzerland_d01_72h_qcfz_20260616T115735Z`, default
Thompson/RRTMG/MYNN/Noah, 72 hourly `wrfout` leads) paired cell-for-cell against
the retained CPU-WRF truth (`v014_switzerland_72h_cpu_20260610T122909Z`), scored
against the **frozen** tolerance manifest. 10 fields scored, **9 within tolerance**,
the single miss being `RAINNC` (5.22 mm vs the 1.0 mm bound). Manifest:
`proofs/v018/identity_proof/switzerland_d01/identity_proof_manifest.json`.

## Quickstart using AI (clone -> ask an agent)

If you want to run a forecast rather than develop the port, you can clone this
repo, open an AI coding agent in the checkout, and say: "Here is my input, get it
running." The repo ships an operator runbook, [AI_OPERATOR.md](AI_OPERATOR.md),
plus a Claude Code skill at `.claude/skills/run-wrf-gpu/`, so agents can load the
right instructions: set up Python/JAX, check the GPU, run the bundled Switzerland
smoke test, then run your case with the real `gpuwrf run` CLI.

The AI path keeps the same honesty as this README: unsupported namelist options
fail closed, the default is fp64, opt-in modes stay opt-in, and the broader
24 h/72 h forecast-skill gate is not claimed closed by a successful run.

## Quickstart

A fresh clone → install → **standalone GPU forecast** → `wrfout` in three steps.
Full walk-through (prerequisites, troubleshooting, output): **[docs/quickstart.md](docs/quickstart.md)**.

> **Prerequisite environment variables.** The table-using schemes (Noah-MP and
> RRTM/RRTMG) load lookup tables from a pristine WRF v4 install at runtime, so two
> paths must be set before you run a case that selects them:
>
> | Variable | Required for | What it points to |
> | --- | --- | --- |
> | `GPUWRF_WRF_ROOT` | Noah-MP, RRTM/RRTMG | Root of a pristine WRF v4 source/run tree — provides the RRTM/RRTMG `.F` sources and the `run/` tables (including `run/CCN_ACTIVATE.BIN` for Thompson aerosol). |
> | `GPUWRF_CANAIRY_ROOT` | the validation cases | The `met_em` / run corpus root for the validation cases (run inputs + CPU-WRF reference). |
>
> Optional (performance / scratch, all defaulted): `GPUWRF_JAX_CACHE_DIR` — the
> persistent JIT-cache location (the standard JAX `JAX_COMPILATION_CACHE_DIR` is
> also honored as an alias) — and `GPUWRF_TMPDIR` (scratch root, default
> `~/.cache/gpuwrf`).
>
> Without `GPUWRF_WRF_ROOT` set, the table-loading schemes (Noah-MP, RRTM/RRTMG)
> **fail closed with a clear named error** before any compute — they never silently
> substitute a scheme. Cases whose physics menu does not use those schemes run
> without it.

```bash
# 1. Clone + install (CUDA 13 GPU build of JAX, then the package)
git clone https://github.com/wrf-gpu/wrf_gpu.git && cd wrf_gpu
python -m venv .venv && . .venv/bin/activate     # or: conda create -n wrfgpu python=3.11
pip install --upgrade "jax[cuda13]"
pip install -e .
python -c "import jax; print(jax.devices())"     # should list a cuda device

# 2. Run the BUNDLED Switzerland 3 km case — real GFS-initialized inputs that ship
#    in the repo at examples/switzerland_d01 (wrfinput_d01 + wrfbdy_d01 +
#    namelist.input; native-init, no CPU wrfout needed). Its physics (RRTMG
#    radiation + Noah-MP) read WRF tables, so point GPUWRF_WRF_ROOT at your pristine
#    WRF v4 tree first (see the prerequisite box above):
export GPUWRF_WRF_ROOT=/path/to/your/WRF        # your pristine WRF v4 source/run tree
python -m gpuwrf.cli run \
    --input-dir   examples/switzerland_d01 \
    --output-dir  runs/switzerland_d01 \
    --domain      d01 \
    --hours       1 \
    --scratch-dir /tmp/gpuwrf_scratch           # any real (non-tmpfs) fast disk

# 3. Read the WRF-compatible history file
ncdump -h runs/switzerland_d01/wrfout_d01_*
```

> The bundled `examples/switzerland_d01` inputs are derived from public-domain
> NCEP **GFS** analysis (2023-01-15 00Z, 42×42 @ 3 km, 44 levels) via WPS/`real.exe`
> — freely redistributable. They need **only** `GPUWRF_WRF_ROOT`;
> `GPUWRF_CANAIRY_ROOT` is for the larger Canary validation corpus, not this case.

`run` **auto-detects** the input directory: a case with a CPU-WRF `wrfout` →
replay mode; a case with only `real.exe` outputs → **standalone native-init mode**
(assembles `wrfinput`/`wrfbdy` and integrates on the GPU, **no CPU-WRF
dependency**). Bring your existing WRF `namelist.input` — the supported matrix runs
as-is; unsupported options fail closed with a named reason
([docs/namelist-compatibility.md](docs/namelist-compatibility.md)).

For a **live-nested** forecast (d01→d02→d03, down to the 1 km nest), add
`--max-dom N` — the parent builds each child's lateral boundary **live**, with no
pre-supplied `wrfbdy_d02`:

```bash
python -m gpuwrf.cli run --input-dir my_case --output-dir runs/nested \
    --max-dom 3 --hours 24 --scratch-dir /fast/nvme/gpuwrf_scratch
```

> Remember the **one-time cold compile** (no output) on the first run; later runs
> read the persistent JIT cache. Compile time **scales with domain size**: the
> bundled single-domain d01 case compiles in roughly **½–2 min**, while a large
> nested case can take **~8–12 min**. See the box at the top.

### Run JUST the current version without the full repo (VERIFIED)

You do not need the whole repository (proofs, agent infrastructure, validation
corpora) to *run* `wrf_gpu`. A **cone sparse-checkout of just `src` + the vendored
runtime data tables** is enough — the working tree shrinks from the full repo to a
source-only install. This path was **verified end-to-end fresh** (clone → sparse →
`pip install -e .` → `import gpuwrf` → `python -m gpuwrf.cli run --help`, all
succeeding) on a clean machine; evidence:
`proofs/v018/quickstart_minimal_source_verified.txt`.

```bash
# Shallow, no-checkout clone, then cone-sparse-checkout only what `run` needs.
git clone --depth 1 --no-checkout \
    https://github.com/wrf-gpu/wrf_gpu.git wrf_gpu && cd wrf_gpu
git sparse-checkout init --cone
# In cone mode the root files (pyproject.toml, README.md, LICENSE_NOTES.md) come
# automatically; add the source package and the vendored runtime data tables
# (the Thompson/RRTMG tables are loaded at import — `src` alone is not enough):
git sparse-checkout set src data/fixtures
git checkout

# Install (CPU import works without a GPU; add the CUDA jaxlib to run on GPU):
python -m venv .venv && . .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e .                  # CPU import-check; or:
pip install -e ".[cuda]"          # GPU execution (CUDA 13 jaxlib)

# Verify:
python -c "import gpuwrf; print('wrf_gpu', gpuwrf.__version__)"
python -m gpuwrf.cli run --help   # the CLI is the entrypoint
```

`pip install` builds and installs the `gpuwrf` package and its runtime
dependencies (`jax`, `numpy`, `netCDF4`, `xarray`, …). A plain `pip install -e .`
pulls in CPU `jax` so the **import and namelist-validation paths work without a
GPU**; GPU execution needs the CUDA jaxlib (`pip install "jax[cuda13]"` or the
`cuda` extra). The vendored `data/fixtures/` tables (~147 MiB: Thompson + RRTMG)
are required at import — that is the only large data the runtime itself needs.

## Use the manager (agent-driven development)

This repository is built to be run and extended by an **AI manager agent** — the
shipped skill `.agent/skills/managing-sprints` is the operating manual. To drive
the project this way:

1. **Clone the repo on an isolated machine or VM** (the agent runs commands and the
   GPU; isolate it).
2. **Start Claude Code or a GPT/codex agent in auto-permission mode** in the repo
   directory.
3. **Tell it: "you are now the manager."** From that point the shipped
   `managing-sprints` skill tells it **where everything is and what to do** — read
   order (`PROJECT_CONSTITUTION.md` → `AGENTS.md` → the sprint contract → the
   relevant `.agent/skills`), the evidence/proof-object rules, how to dispatch and
   gate sub-agents (Opus ↔ GPT critic for kernel/perf-core work), the GPU lock, and
   the release protocol.

The manager assigns sprints, runs the acceptance gates, and merges — you steer it
at the milestone/decision level, not per-command.

## Performance

Measured on the reference RTX 5090 workstation vs same-box CPU-WRF.

> **What v0.21.0 changed for performance.** v0.21.0 improves **compile and
> warm-start time** (version-keyed cache + the default-on AOT cheap-key warm-start
> that skips the multi-tens-of-minutes re-lower — MEASURED on the 9-nest fused
> stress: both fused phases load `source=aot_blob` cross-process, 0 re-lower, all 9
> domains finite) and **stability** (the 9-nest is now finite through the step-67
> divergence window). It does **not** change warm forecast throughput — the
> s/forecast-hour numbers below are the measured fused runtime numbers and remain
> current for the default path, which stays byte-identical. De-fuse is an explicit
> low-host-compile-RAM fallback with a documented runtime cost (+18.8% s/step,
> measured), so it is **not** the default.

- **v0.20.0 makes the all-7 nested fast path faster than v0.19 and CPU,
  byte-identically.** The default fused all-7-island, 9-domain run measures
  **~668 s/forecast-hour warm** (range 645–680) on the reference GPU versus
  **713 s/forecast-hour for v0.19** and the canonical **12-rank CPU-WRF baseline
  at 1020 s/forecast-hour** — **~1.07× faster than v0.19** and **~1.53× faster
  than CPU**. The output is **byte-identical to v0.19 (1926/1926 vars,
  maxΔ=0.000e+00)**: the gain comes entirely from a **numerics-free CUDA
  stream-ordered allocator** (`cuda_async`, now the default), which carries
  essentially the whole improvement (~+44 s/forecast-hour); the async-output and
  host-RAM-guard levers are stability/neutral by design. Peak VRAM is **122 MiB
  leaner** than v0.19 and stays flat over 12 output groups (1 km fit, no OOM).
  *Honest framing:* this nest is **host-bound** (~7–8% GPU duty) and the headline
  is a **range, not a point** — measured under live CPU-corpus contention with
  ~±2–3% run-to-run noise; the relative cuda_async win and all identity/fit/VRAM
  gates are robust regardless. The bigger structural multipliers (acoustic
  substep config, fused megakernel, fp32-relaxed tolerance) are an explicit
  **future wave, NOT in v0.20**.
  *[MEASURED: COMBINED_SPEEDUP.md §4–§8.]*
- **fp64 default is byte-identical and same-speed as v0.19.** The fp64_default
  GPU all-7 9-domain output is **963/963 vars maxΔ=0.000e+00, byte-identical**;
  warm fp64 forecast-only time is **HEAD ≈ baseline** (within noise). v0.20 adds
  no numerics risk on the default path.
  *[MEASURED: FP32_INTEGRATION_REPORT.md §4.1/§4.1b.]*
- **fp32 mixed-precision is opt-in, capability/VRAM-only.** It reduces whole-run
  VRAM **−14.4%** (aggressive) and fits **~1.16×** more cells; on the single card
  it is **NOT a speedup** (fp32/fp64 throughput-ceiling ratio **≈0.91**), and its
  tolerance is checked only at the **1 h lead** (not the 24–120 h skill gate).
  *[MEASURED on VRAM/capability; INCONCLUSIVE on single-card speed: V0200-STATE; T2T3 R∞≈0.91.]*
- **The compile cache just works out of the box, including across dates.** On by
  default, persistent per-user, zero config; warm after the first run; and **new
  in v0.20** a warm hit **across forecast dates** (0 new cache entries on a new or
  leap-year date), default path bit-identical.
  *[MEASURED: JULDAY_CACHE_FIX_REPORT.md.]*
- **Single-domain scaling is measured and honest.** On a tiny single-domain 129²
  grid the GPU is **~2.3× slower** than 24-rank CPU-WRF (host/launch-bound). It
  pulls ahead at 1 km / large / nested scale. A parametrized single-domain
  scaling study (Swiss base, tiled) shows throughput saturating at a ceiling of
  **~9.6e6 cells/s (fp32) / ~1.06e7 cells/s (fp64)** by ~384²; fp32 **fits 512²
  (11.5 M cells) where fp64 OOMs** (capability), with **no single-domain speed
  win** from fp32.
  *[MEASURED: T2T3_REPORT.md G-series + Swiss-CPU-match.]*
- **The single-card ceiling, restated.** The tiny-nest all-7 is
  **GPU-compute-bound at ~674 s/forecast-hour** — an nsys trace shows many ~1.5 µs
  kernels with no hot-spot (a launch/occupancy limit, not a throughput limit). So
  **fp32 cannot move it** and **≥2× / 3× are NOT single-card reachable** for this
  tiny-nest geometry. The genuine speedup/scale levers are **algorithmic +
  multi-GPU**, not fp32.
  *[MEASURED: HISTORICAL §CASE-1 (~674 floor); prior nsys, v0.17.]*

**HEADLINE = correctness + stability + capability + reliability, plus a modest
measured nest speedup.** **MEASURED:** 1 km single domain fits one RTX 5090
bit-identically; the all-7 1 km nested case runs end-to-end on one card;
v0.20.0 default fused mode is **~1.07× faster than v0.19 / ~1.53× faster than the
12-rank CPU-WRF baseline, byte-identical to v0.19**; fp32 opt-in cuts VRAM
**−14.4%** and fits **~1.16×** more cells; the cache hits across runs **and dates**
out of the box. **PROJECTED / UNMEASURED:** larger single grids and higher
throughput on bigger GPUs (H200 — measurable via the parametrized harness),
**cluster / multi-GPU weak-scaling** (e.g. one domain across a GB300-NVL72), and
whole-Earth-at-1 km "fits one rack" (exact memory arithmetic; an SPMD shard_map +
collective-halo foundation is bit-identity-validated on a fake/CPU mesh, but
**real multi-GPU throughput is not benchmarked — no perfect-scaling claim**).
Detail: [docs/PERFORMANCE.md](docs/PERFORMANCE.md).

## Scaling, energy & capability — where this rewrite gets exciting (and where it doesn't yet)

The section above is the per-release performance summary; this one is the
figure-driven scaling story behind it. There is a single physical story behind
every number here: **a clean
GPU-native dycore is overhead-dominated when the grid is tiny and
roofline-dominated when the grid is large.** That one fact explains both the
genuinely exciting part — *the bigger and higher-resolution you go, the more this
architecture wins* — and the honest small print — *on a postage-stamp grid a
24-rank CPU is still faster.* Everything below is labeled **MEASURED** (a real
run / device counter) or **DERIVED** (a roofline fit or a timing-derived
denominator), and no number is invented.

### The scaling law 

A controlled single-domain Switzerland sweep (3 km, 44 levels) tiled to
increasing horizontal extent — **4 fp32 + 3 fp64 real runs** on the reference
RTX 5090. Read it by **throughput (cells/s)**, not raw wall-clock: throughput is
what reveals the law.

![Single-domain warm scaling and the throughput roofline R∞](docs/assets/v021/fig_perf_scaling.png)

| grid | cells | fp32 s/fc-h | fp64 s/fc-h | fp32 cells/s | fp64 cells/s | fp32 VRAM | fp64 VRAM |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 128²×44 | 0.72 M | 30.5 | 32.6 | 8.5e6 | 8.0e6 | 7.4 / 12.8 GB | 7.4 / 12.8 GB |
| 256²×44 | 2.88 M | 116.6 | 100.8 | 8.9e6 | 1.03e7 | 7.4 / 13.4 GB | 7.4 / 12.7 GB |
| 384²×44 | 6.49 M | 232.6 | 237.5 | 1.00e7 | 9.83e6 | 9.8 / 22.0 GB | 9.2 / 21.1 GB |
| 512²×44 | 11.53 M | 444.5 | OOM (~32 GB) | 9.34e6 | — | 16.2 / 29.8 GB | — |

*(MEASURED: per-grid runtimes on a RTX5090, throughput, VRAM, and the 512² fp64 OOM point.)*

Wall-clock rises with grid size — but throughput **climbs and saturates at a
hardware ceiling R∞ (DERIVED from the roofline fit): fp64 ≈ 1.06×10⁷ cells/s,
fp32 ≈ 9.6×10⁶ cells/s.** That ceiling is the headline: it says the device is
busy doing real arithmetic, not waiting on launch overhead, once the grid is big
enough. The opt-in fp32 mode is precision-only (unchanged topology), so it tracks
fp64 throughput (R∞ ratio ≈ 0.91) but **fits a 512² / 11.5 M-cell grid where fp64
OOMs near 32 GB** — a VRAM/capability win, not a single-card speedup.

### Cross-platform anchors — and the bigger iron

![Cross-platform speedup anchors, each labeled with its own denominator](docs/assets/v021/fig_perf_anchors.png)

Every bar is labeled with its own denominator so nothing is mixed up:

- **MEASURED:** a **B200 is ≈2.69× the RTX 5090** at the 128² anchor; and the
  only *nested, real* speedup is the v0.19 fused all-7 9-domain path at **~1.53×
  the same-box 12-rank CPU-WRF** (~1.43× in the v0.19 measurement), byte-identical
  to v0.19.
- **DERIVED:** the asymptotic-throughput ratio puts a **B200 at ≈3.53× the 5090**,
  and ≈10.0× a timing-derived Swiss CPU-WRF throughput denominator.

This is the multi-GPU / cluster path stated honestly: the *capability* (memory
arithmetic, fake-mesh bit-identity) is proven, the bigger-iron throughput ratios
are derived, and **real multi-GPU throughput is not yet benchmarked** — no
single-card multi-× headline and no perfect-scaling claim.

### Energy efficiency — order-of-magnitude at the device level (MEASURED), honest about scope

![Device-level energy efficiency — kWh per cell-step](docs/assets/v021/fig_energy.png)

**MEASURED (device/board power only):** on the scaling ladder the best B200 point
is **4.83×10⁻¹² kWh per cell-step** (at 384²) versus a CPU RAPL package-power
**sample** of **1.47×10⁻¹¹** — roughly an **order of magnitude fewer joules per
cell-step** at the device level for large grids (≈3.05× at the best point, ≈2.81×
ladder-aggregate). **DERIVED:** the CPU point applies a current package-power
sample to the measured Swiss CPU-WRF wall time (not a historical same-run log).
**Honest scope: whole-node / PSU energy is NOT measured (an open gap), and there
is no same-large-grid CPU run.** The CPU baseline is a modern Zen-5 part, so this
is not a legacy-CPU strawman.

### Capability — a real 1 km Alpine forecast on one professional GPU (MEASURED)

![Real 1 km Alpine forecast — nested d02, 1023² @ 1 km, on a single NVIDIA B200](docs/assets/v022/fig_capability_b200_1km_alpine.png)

**MEASURED — a real forecast, not just terrain.** A live **1023 × 1023 @ 1 km
nested inner domain (d02)** — the whole Alpine arc at ~**1023 km × 1023 km,
1.05 M cells × 44 levels** — run as a real 3 km→1 km nested forecast on a
**single NVIDIA B200**. The panels are a genuine forecast frame (valid
2024-08-06 13:00 UTC): the 1 km terrain with the 10 m wind field and flow
streamlines, and the 1 km 2 m-temperature field. It runs the **full operational
physics** — Thompson microphysics, RRTMG long- and short-wave radiation, MYNN
PBL + surface layer, Noah-MP land — with **explicit convection at 1 km (no
cumulus parameterization)**, and the output carries the **cloud-relevant fields**
(`QCLOUD`, `QICE`, `QRAIN`, `QSNOW`, `QGRAUP`, `CLDFRA`) among its 47 variables.

This whole alpine-wide 1 km state fits in **well under a third of a single
B200's 180 GB** (≈58 GB at fp64 — a design-anchor estimate; this production run
did not log a peak-VRAM trace), and the full nested cascade advances in the
**tens-of-minutes-of-wall-clock-per-forecast-hour** range (a precise warm
throughput benchmark on this grid awaits a dedicated B200 timing run; this frame
predates the v0.22.2 output-path speedups). **Multi-GPU distribution is possible
by kernel design** — the domain-decomposition path is bit-identity-proven on a
CPU fake mesh, but **real multi-GPU throughput is untested**.

The point is plain: even a **standard single-GPU system** can now compute
**almost continent-sized grids at 1 km** with this port (and the opt-in fp32
mode stretches that further), and we have run **real forecasts on a real
professional GPU** to prove it — not just held the terrain in memory.

*(Forecast frame from the v0.21.1 B200 production run; the default fp64 forecast
is byte-identical through the current v0.22.2.)*

**The whole Earth at 1 km fits in a single rack (PROJECTED).** The global 1 km
50-level state — ~25 billion cells, ~4.3 TB (≈13 TB with solver working memory) —
fits in the HBM of one NVIDIA GB300 NVL72. This is **exact memory arithmetic, a
"where this is going" note, not a near-term capability**: the multi-GPU
domain-decomposition path is bit-identity-proven on a CPU fake mesh only, **real
multi-GPU throughput is not yet shipped**, and a global wall-clock figure is
**not claimed**.

> scaling story does **not** erase the open gaps: (1) the **24–120 h
> forecast-skill equivalence gate is OPEN** — the 24 h equivalence demo is

> the default path.

### Apples-to-apples vs AceCAST (EXPECTATION / PROJECTED — not measured)

`wrf_gpu` is not the first GPU WRF effort — commercial directive-based ports
(**AceCAST**, OpenACC WRF) and other open efforts (`FahrenheitResearch`) exist.
**No head-to-head benchmark has been run:** there is no AceCAST wall-clock on our
cases, our GPU, or our precision regime, and AceCAST is fp32-dominant
directive-accelerated Fortran whereas our dynamical core is fp64 by design. On a
**like-for-like basis — same GPU class, same precision regime, same domain size,
same physics — we EXPECT to land in the same ballpark as hand-tuned-CUDA/OpenACC
ports like AceCAST**, because the dominant cost is the same memory-bound stencil +
column-physics work and our fp64 core is already device-bound / near-roofline. This
is an **EXPECTATION / PROJECTED positioning note, not an established competitive
claim** — we do **not** claim parity with, or an advantage over, AceCAST. Reasoning
and what would turn it into a measured claim:
[`proofs/v018/acecast_reconciliation.md`](proofs/v018/acecast_reconciliation.md).

**Performance / identity env flags**:
`GPUWRF_BITWISE=1` or `GPUWRF_NESTED_FUSE=0` (eager non-fused bitwise/debug path),
`GPUWRF_NESTED_AOT=0` (opt out of the v0.21.0 AOT cheap-key warm-start, **on by
default** on the fused path — a fresh load is numerically inert),
`GPUWRF_AOT_VERIFY=1` (fail-closed lower-once + HLO-digest warm-load verification
backstop, default off),
`GPUWRF_FINITE_CHECK=0` (opt out of the **default-on** fail-fast finite guard —
observational on finite states; opt out only for max-performance experiments),
`GPUWRF_NESTED_DEFUSE_COMPILE=1` / `GPUWRF_NESTED_PARALLEL_COMPILE=N` (opt-in
low-host-compile-RAM de-fuse path + optional parallel prewarm; **slower runtime**,
not the default),
`GPUWRF_NESTED_SYNC_MODE` (`root` default / `advance` / `segment`),
`GPUWRF_EDGE_ONLY_BOUNDARY` (ring-only boundary, **default on, bit-identical**),
`GPUWRF_JIT_BOUNDARY` (jit the boundary builder, default off),
`GPUWRF_ALLOCATOR` (live-nested GPU allocator: `cuda_async` **default** — the
CUDA stream-ordered pool, pooled but fragmentation-free; `platform` — the
synchronous cudaMalloc/cudaFree fallback used before v0.20; `bfc` — the XLA
default arena. An explicit `XLA_PYTHON_CLIENT_ALLOCATOR` overrides this. Choice
is numerics-free — it changes only where device buffers live, not the math),
`GPUWRF_HOST_LEDGER` (per-phase host-time diagnostic),
`GPUWRF_ACOUSTIC_PRECISION_MODE` (`fp64_default` **default**, byte-identical;
`mixed_perturb_fp32_v020` — opt-in perturbation-authoritative fp32 for VRAM /
capability, **not** a single-card speedup; see the fp32 subsection above).

## System requirements & resource profile

Measured on the reference RTX 5090. Full detail: **[docs/resource-profile.md](docs/resource-profile.md)**.

| Resource | What to expect |
|---|---|
| GPU / VRAM | The **1 km-NESTED all-island AC1_FIT case** (9/3/1, d03 520x280x45, ~145k columns) now fits the reference RTX 5090 at **~18.1 GiB peak VRAM**; before v0.18.2 it OOMed near **31.8/32 GiB**. Retained 72 h gate peaks: **22.9 GiB** (Switzerland d01) / **29.8 GiB** (Canary L2 d02, nested); d01 9 km standalone peaks **≈ 4.7 GiB**; the 1 km single domain fits in a fresh process at **18.25 GiB** (chunked BouLac). Peak is transient working memory, not persistent fp64 State; the v0.18.2 levers are bit-identical radiation/cold-start column tiling, with multi-GPU still the scale path. |
| First-run compile / warm-start | A one-time cold JIT compile (no output during compile), scaling with grid size — a few minutes for ordinary single-domain/nested programs, tens of minutes for the large all-7 9-domain nest. **New in v0.21.0: a fresh process then warm-LOADS the compiled executable in seconds** via the default-on AOT cheap-key warm-start, which **skips the multi-tens-of-minutes re-lower** the old cache still paid (MEASURED: 9-nest fused stress — both fused phases `source=aot_blob`, 0 re-lower, warm peak host RSS 16.4 GB; 3-domain cold→warm gate byte-identical, no runtime regression). The **persistent on-disk cache** is default-on, zero config, and **version-keyed** (`gpuwrf` + JAX/JAXLIB + backend), so a stale older-release cache is never mistaken for warm; the v0.20 single-domain read was already fast (**cold ~147 s → cache-hit ~29 s** d01 hour-1 wrapper) and **hits across forecast dates** (0 new cache entries on a new/leap-year date), cached executable bit-identical. |
| Scratch | A **real (non-tmpfs) NVMe scratch dir**, a few GiB free. Set via `--scratch-dir` / `$GPUWRF_SCRATCH`. Do **not** use a RAM disk. |
| Throughput | **Warm forecast throughput is unchanged in v0.21.0** (its speed win is compile/warm-start time, not the forecast itself). The measured fused runtime number stands: **v0.20.0 all-7 nested fast path: ~668 s/forecast-hour warm (645–680) vs 713 for v0.19 and 1020 for 12-rank CPU-WRF — ~1.07× vs v0.19, ~1.53× vs CPU, byte-identical to v0.19 (1926/1926, maxΔ=0)**. On a tiny 129² single domain the GPU is ~2.3× slower than 24-rank CPU (host-bound); it pulls ahead at 1 km/large/nested scale. No multi-× single-card speedup is claimed. See [docs/PERFORMANCE.md](docs/PERFORMANCE.md). |
| Runtime data | The vendored `data/fixtures/` tables (~147 MiB: Thompson + RRTMG) are loaded at import; a minimal run install needs `src` + `data/fixtures` (see the source-only quickstart above). |
| Toolchain | CUDA 13 + a JAX CUDA build that sees the GPU. |

## Version history

Newest first. Full per-release evidence is under [`proofs/`](proofs/) and the
`RELEASE_NOTES_v*.md` files.

| Version | Headline | Key proof / link |
|---|---|---|
| **v0.23.2** | **Batched-ensemble distinct-init CLI ergonomics; numerically identical to v0.23.1.** `GPUWRF_BATCH_INPUT_DIRS` now accepts a **comma**-separated list of the B distinct-day input dirs (the old `:`-only separator still works), with an actionable count-mismatch error — fixes an operational fallback where a natural comma list parsed as one dir. Documents + verifies the distinct-init contract (nested one-way, exactly B same-geometry dirs; only the day differs). No dynamics/physics change; the batched vmap math is unchanged. New CPU unit tests. | [`RELEASE_NOTES_v0.23.2.md`](release_notes/RELEASE_NOTES_v0.23.2.md) |
| **v0.23.1** | **Usability + AI-native onboarding; no dynamics/physics/default-numeric change (numerically identical to v0.23.0).** Ships a full static HTML **[User's Guide](https://wrf-gpu.github.io/wrf_gpu/)** (GitHub-Pages-ready, searchable) and an **[AI operator skill](AI_OPERATOR.md)** (`AI_OPERATOR.md` + a Claude Code skill + `AGENTS.md`/`CLAUDE.md` routing) so an agent can clone → set up → run a user's case, narrating each step. Backward-compatible **WRF-parity CLI**: `--hours` and `--domain` default from `namelist.input` (`&time_control`; root domain `d01`) when omitted (explicit flags always win); new `--domains-from-namelist`, `gpuwrf namelist-support` (offline), `--dry-run`; clearer `GPUWRF_WRF_ROOT` errors; effective-values in the run payload. Doc-accuracy fixes (init = `wrfinput`/`wrfbdy`; 39-var training subset). CLI covered by CPU unit tests; forecast pipeline unchanged. | [`RELEASE_NOTES_v0.23.1.md`](release_notes/RELEASE_NOTES_v0.23.1.md), [`docs/WRF_PARITY_ROADMAP.md`](docs/WRF_PARITY_ROADMAP.md) |
| **v0.23.0** | **Batched-ensemble GPU saturation on small grids + default-path launch/compile-count reductions + extended physics (opt-in / reference-only); default numerically equivalent to v0.22.2.** A new **opt-in batched ensemble** (`GPUWRF_BATCH_ENSEMBLE=B`) runs B independent, same-geometry forecasts concurrently under one outer `jax.vmap` wrapped around the unbatched orchestration, filling the launch/occupancy-bound small-grid GPU: measured Tenerife 3 km→1 km 2-nest warm total throughput climbs **4.51 → 5.63 M cells-in-flight/s (B=1→4) = ~97 % of the 5.81 M large-grid (Alps 433²@1 km, compute-bound) saturation ceiling** on one RTX 5090 (B_max=5 is VRAM-capped at ~26 GiB; a larger card batches further). The default (`unset`/`=1`) is byte-identical. Default-path **value-preserving** work reductions: **P0** M9 radiation flux-slice reduction (computes only the surface/TOA flux slices the wrfout writer consumes; CPU bit-identical 17/17) and **P3** flat-2-domain root fusion (3→1 entry programs; fail-closed for every other topology; CPU sha256 fused==eager) — the dynamical core is untouched (net dynamics diff vs v0.22.2 = **0 lines**). Extended physics, all namelist-gated: **New-Tiedtke cumulus (`cu_physics=16`)** and **Morrison-aerosol microphysics (`mp_physics=40`)** ported and validated to machine precision vs pristine-WRF single-column oracles, **RUC-LSM** integrated; **NSSL 2-moment (`mp=18`), CAM-UW PBL (`bl_pbl_physics=9`), urban BEP/BEM (`sf_urban=2/3`) and the WRF lake model (`sf_lake=1`) are reference-only / fail-closed** (verified oracles; faithful ports are their own milestones). An **opt-in operational moving-nest driver** is added (static-nest path byte-identical). **Default = numerically equivalent to v0.22.2**: with XLA autotune held fixed the default path is bit-identical (`max_abs 0.0`, 0/178 leaves), and across two independent cold compiles it matches v0.22.2 within the autotune floor — self-control-verified (v0.23-vs-v0.22.2 field diffs over the 1 h canary are indistinguishable from v0.22.2 differing from its own recompile). Canary benchmark 407 vs 411 s/forecast-hour, no regression. **fp32-operational (M1) foundation is laid but NOT enabled by default (its own milestone); the open 24–120 h skill gate is not claimed closed.** No masking / clamps / `nan_to_num`. | [`RELEASE_NOTES_v0.23.0.md`](release_notes/RELEASE_NOTES_v0.23.0.md) |
| **v0.22.2** | **Nested-grid wall-clock — host-bound GPU-idle reduction; default byte-identical.** Cuts the host work at the nested output boundary. Default-on, **byte-identical** host-work reductions (one redundant full finite-summary removed, the per-leaf device→host pulls and the finite guard batched, subset-aware payload build) measure **~9 % faster nested steady-state** (789 vs 865 s/forecast-hour on a 384² 2-nest, output **byte-identical** to v0.22.1). A default-on **bit-identical** RRTMG column-tile cap on the per-output radiation re-solve **halves its VRAM transient** (~5.1 → ~2.6 GiB), fixing a convection-peak OOM on larger grids — the main-forecast radiation cap is unchanged. Opt-in `GPUWRF_NEST_OUTPUT_PIPELINE=1` overlaps the output materialization; `GPUWRF_NESTED_M9_RADIATION_FROM_CARRY=1` skips the re-solve (lossy). **No new physics; the open 24–120 h skill gate is not claimed closed.** | [`RELEASE_NOTES_v0.22.2.md`](release_notes/RELEASE_NOTES_v0.22.2.md) |
| **v0.22.1** | **Nested d02 output-cadence fix + opt-in colon-free wrfout names; bit-identical.** Point release for B200 pod output-path defects: leaf children now honor their own `history_interval` on both the eager and the default fused paths (a fused flat leaf subtree falls back to the eager split when a child cadence is not parent-ratio aligned), restoring the intended training-frame yield. `GPUWRF_COLONFREE_OUTPUT=1` writes `HH-MM-SS` names for S3 / network drains; the default stays WRF-standard `HH:MM:SS`. No numerics, masking, clamp, or schema change. | [`RELEASE_NOTES_v0.22.1.md`](release_notes/RELEASE_NOTES_v0.22.1.md) |
| **v0.22.0** | **Default-safe hygiene + opt-in K2 lever + ADR release; default forecast behavior unchanged from v0.21.1.** Adds opt-in AOT-signature hardening (treedef / leaf-count token), `GPUWRF_WRF_ROOT` data-root portability, and byte-identical async wrfout. Documents `time_step` / `n_sound` (K2) as an **opt-in single-domain** CFL-gated lever (1.80× on a Switzerland-128 short gate; no nested / default speed claim), corrects the compile-wall story (compile *time*, not host RAM, is the wall; 3-domain sound peak RSS ≈ 22.3 GiB), and ratifies the operational-relaxed acceptance-tier ADR. | [`RELEASE_NOTES_v0.22.0.md`](release_notes/RELEASE_NOTES_v0.22.0.md) |
| **v0.21.1** | **Mont-Blanc extreme-terrain boundary-stability fix.** Point release off v0.21.0: restores standalone-root specified-boundary cadence and WRF-faithful physical-`W` zero-gradient boundary semantics. d01 max `|W|` bounded over the 2 h proof window — **no masking / `nan_to_num` / finite guard / clamp**. | [`RELEASE_NOTES_v0.21.1.md`](release_notes/RELEASE_NOTES_v0.21.1.md) |
| **v0.21.0** | **Stability + compile-cache-speed; warm forecast throughput unchanged + byte-identical on the default path.** Priority order **stability > identity > speed > memory**. **AOT cheap-key cross-process warm-start (default on, fused path):** after a one-time cold compile, a fresh process loads the compiled GPU executable from disk via a cheap metadata key (computed **without lowering**) and **skips the multi-tens-of-minutes re-lower** the old cache still paid (MEASURED: 3-domain cold→warm gate byte-identical, `REF_COMPARE` equal / max_abs_diff 0, no runtime regression; 9-nest fused stress both fused phases `source=aot_blob`, 0 re-lower, all 9 domains finite, warm peak host RSS 16.4 GB). **Dycore boundary-stability fix** takes the all-7 9-domain Canary nest **finite through the old step-67 divergence window** (mechanism fix, identity-preserving on the CPU regression baseline, zero new regressions). **Default-on fail-fast finite guard** (`GPUWRF_FINITE_CHECK`) reports the first non-finite prognostic `{domain, field, level, step, sim-time, index}`. **Version-keyed compile cache** + default-on autotune cache; opt-in steep-terrain GPU gate. **De-fuse is opt-in only** (low host-compile-RAM, measured **+18.8% s/step ⇒ reverted as default**); runtime default stays fused. **Carried:** most-extreme 1 km Mont-Blanc (~1042 m/cell) terrain not fully stabilized (relocates → v0.21.1); long-horizon 9-nest can still OOM around the ~90 min horizon; open 24–120 h skill gate not closed. No new physics. | [`RELEASE_NOTES_v0.21.0.md`](release_notes/RELEASE_NOTES_v0.21.0.md) |
| **v0.20.1** | **Reliability + I/O-readiness patch; fp64 default byte-identical to v0.20.0.** No single-card speedup. The warm compile cache now **hits across forecast dates for the nested path too** (#114 — a new/leap date is a warm hit, the fused nest is not recompiled; saves the ~50 min cold compile, net ~30 min/date since you still pay a one-time module load/link — **warm, not "instant"**; bit-identical default path). Adds an **opt-in compact training-output mode** (`GPUWRF_TRAINING_OUTPUT_SUBSET`, 36-var subset + coordinates, lossless; **off by default**, default output byte-identical). **GPU OOM-hardening for the nested path (mitigation, not a blanket fix):** a `--max-dom > 1` CPU-side **VRAM-headroom preflight** that fails closed (exit 75) before the ~50 min compile, plus an RRTMG column-tile cap 2048→1024 that cuts the radiation transient's largest alloc **0.432 → 0.271 GiB (−37 %, GPU-measured), bit-identical (`max_abs = 0.0`)** — but solo `cuda_async` fragmentation **can still OOM the full fp64 nest** (reproducer shipped; **no OOM-proof / fp32-nest / 24 h large-nest claim**). Adds **CPU-only paid-B200 I/O tooling** (manifest/dimension validation + block drain/resume/stop-pull with read-back-verify-before-delete; tested on synthetic/local dry-runs only). **Honesty refresh** (perf framing, memory accounting, identity metric — inner-nest `TH2` low-`r` is a **low-variance Pearson artifact, not a bug**; now also reports variance-robust `nRMSE`), no fabricated numbers. Open 24–120 h skill gate carried, not closed. | [`RELEASE_NOTES_v0.20.1.md`](release_notes/RELEASE_NOTES_v0.20.1.md), [`proofs/v013/rrtmg_column_tile.json`](proofs/v013/rrtmg_column_tile.json) |
| **v0.20.0** | **Correctness + stability + capability + reliability; modest measured nest speedup.** Default fused all-7 9-domain nest is **~1.07× faster than v0.19 / ~1.53× faster than 12-rank CPU-WRF (~668 vs 713 vs 1020 s/forecast-hour), byte-identical to v0.19 (1926/1926, maxΔ=0)** — gain from a numerics-free `cuda_async` allocator (now default). Adds **opt-in fp32 mixed-precision** (`mixed_perturb_fp32_v020`) for **−14.4% VRAM / ~1.16× cell capability** (fp64 default byte-identical, 963/963 maxΔ=0; fp32 is **not** a single-card speedup, tolerance checked at 1 h only). **Compile cache now hits across forecast dates** (#91 — 0 new cache entries on new/leap dates, default path 64/64 byte-identical), zero config. GPU-vs-CPU all-7 24 h identity: **core EXCELLENT — T corr 0.9999 (RMSE 0.69 K), PH/PSFC 0.9997, U 0.991, V 0.968, QVAPOR 0.964; surface diagnostics looser (most parameterization-sensitive) — T2 0.944 (RMSE 0.78 K), TH2 0.878, U10 0.855, V10 0.852 mean corr; on the inner 1 km Alpine nests d06/d07 the 10 m winds spread to corr ~0.48–0.65 / RMSE ~4–5 m/s** — the expected most-sensitive field on complex terrain, **byte-identical to validated v0.19 (not a v0.20 regression)**, divergence grows with lead time; logged as v0.20.1 characterization item (#119). | `proofs/v020/lowhang/COMBINED_SPEEDUP.md`, `proofs/v020/fp32_integration/FP32_INTEGRATION_REPORT.md`, `proofs/v020/julday_cache/JULDAY_CACHE_FIX_REPORT.md`, `proofs/v020/benchmark/T2T3_REPORT.md`, `proofs/v020/validation/identity/`, `RELEASE_NOTES_v0.20.0.md` |
| **v0.19.0** | **Fast all-7 nested fusion + terrain-blend fidelity.** Default fused nesting plus the restored fast `_advance_chunk` loop body makes the all-7-island `max_dom=9` case **1.43x faster than the 12-rank CPU-WRF baseline** (713 vs 1020 s/forecast-hour; best segment 683). The one-time fused compile remains large (~41 min first segment, cached). The live-nest terrain/base-state fix closes the HGT/MUB/PB/PHB red-field class; all 9 domains write finite `wrfout` and the established grid comparator reports 102 fields/domain, 0 tolerance failures. | [`proofs/v019/release_prep/gate_summary.json`](proofs/v019/release_prep/gate_summary.json), [`proofs/v019/release_prep/grid_compare_summary.json`](proofs/v019/release_prep/grid_compare_summary.json), [`RELEASE_NOTES_v0.19.0.md`](release_notes/RELEASE_NOTES_v0.19.0.md) |
| **v0.18.3** | **max_dom=9 compile fix + nested `history_interval` cadence fix, bit-identical.** The all-7-island `--max-dom 9` nest compiled forever (`jit__advance_chunk` constant-folding static `s64[nz]` Thompson scan-index arrays across 9 domain shapes) → now all 9 domain-shape compiles complete **bounded** (≤409 s cold / ≤22 s warm), integrate (~85 % util), and write output. Also fixes the nested pipeline ignoring the namelist `history_interval` (was hardcoded hourly). Default numerics bit-identical (26/26 `wrfout` exact, `max_abs_diff 0.0`); hourly gates unchanged. | [`proofs/v018/maxdom9_fix/report.md`](proofs/v018/maxdom9_fix/report.md), [`RELEASE_NOTES_v0.18.3.md`](release_notes/RELEASE_NOTES_v0.18.3.md) |
| **v0.18.2** | **1 km nested VRAM-efficiency fix, bit-identical.** The AC1_FIT 9/3/1 all-island nested case now fits the reference RTX 5090 (**OOM near 31.8/32 GiB → 18.1 GiB peak**) via radiation column-tile defaults 16384→2048 plus tiled MYNN cold-start. Default numerics unchanged: 26/26 `wrfout` fields exact, MYNN cold-start `qke`/`pblh` diffs 0.0. Warm steady-state utilization is ~85–88%; full-run aggregate is lower because it includes the one-time load/cold-JIT prefix.

| **v0.18.0** | **FEATURE-COMPLETENESS + scheme triage.** Classifies and handles **every WRF v4 namelist scheme**: **50 operational** / **23 reference-only-with-real-oracle** / **33 documented-boundary or proven-irrelevant** (State = 67 leaves; no scheme/leaf dropped). Default **Thompson microphysics is strictly more WRF-faithful than v0.17** (cold-process additions + a warm-process melt/cold-gate fix → cell `qv` bit-exact WRF). **Perf-neutral vs v0.17** (default case, dual-confirmed). Adds **experimental, default-OFF K2 multi-GPU** domain decomposition (periodic-BC bit-exact; specified-BC not yet faithful — lab-only). | [`proofs/v018/integration_report.md`](proofs/v018/integration_report.md), [`proofs/v018/scheme_count_no_clobber.json`](proofs/v018/scheme_count_no_clobber.json), [`proofs/v018/suite_triage.md`](proofs/v018/suite_triage.md), [`docs/IDENTITY_PROOF.md`](docs/IDENTITY_PROOF.md) |
| **v0.17.0** | **PERFORMANCE + ceiling.** Closes the live-nested GPU host-orchestration holes — the **all-7 island nest (`--max-dom 9`) now forecasts at all** (previously recompiled forever → 0 output); default config **bit-identical to v0.16**. Adds an **opt-in fused fast-mode** (`GPUWRF_NESTED_FUSE=1`: util 56→96 %, **~1.27–1.30× vs 12-rank CPU**, tolerance-PASS not bitwise, ~38 min one-time compile). Answers speedup plainly: tiny-nest all-7 is **launch/occupancy-bound (~674 s/hr, nsys-grounded)** — **fp32 cannot move it, ≥2×/3× not single-card reachable**.

Adds **aerosol-aware Thompson** (`mp_physics=28`, WRF-module oracle PASS). Ships a **chunked MYNN BouLac** that makes a **1 km single domain fit one RTX 5090 bit-identically** (dense OOMs at ≈18.8 GiB; chunked fits at 18.25 GiB). **fp32 make-or-break CONCLUDED** (Opus + independent GPT): valid-numerics ceiling **~1.1×**, 0 % VRAM-peak reduction. | [`proofs/v016/coverage/`](proofs/v016/coverage/), [`proofs/v016/coverage_map.json`](proofs/v016/coverage_map.json) |

| v0.13.0 | Lifts the single-GPU VRAM ceiling (**RRTMG VRAM-floor chunking**, SW −88.6 % / LW −43.6 %), turns **GWD on by default on the nested 1 km path**, adds **MYJ+Janjic**, multi-GPU fake-mesh sharding, moisture flux-advection into RK3, clear-sky diagnostics (all opt-in/default-off). | [`proofs/v013/`](proofs/v013/), [`proofs/v0130/`](proofs/v0130/) |

## Scope at a glance — implemented / fail-closed / out-of-scope

A high-level summary of what runs, what is recognized-but-refused (loudly, before
any compute), and what is a deliberate boundary. Full per-scheme support table:
**[docs/namelist-compatibility.md](docs/namelist-compatibility.md)**; open issues:
**[KNOWN_ISSUES.md](KNOWN_ISSUES.md)**.

| Area | Implemented (runs) | Fail-closed (recognized, refused with a named reason) | Out-of-scope / roadmap boundary |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Init** | Native real-init (`wrfinput`/`wrfbdy` from met_em, no `real.exe`); WRF restart | — | — |
| **Dynamics** | Nonhydrostatic ARW, RK3 + split-explicit acoustic, flux-form advection, constant-K (`diff_opt=2`/`km_opt=1`) + 2-D Smagorinsky (`diff_opt=1`/`km_opt=4`) horizontal diffusion | 3-D TKE / full Smagorinsky (`km_opt=2/3/5`) → use `km_opt=1` or `4` | Moving/global nests; adaptive Δt |
| **Microphysics** | Kessler, Purdue-Lin, WSM3/5/6/7, Thompson, **aerosol-aware Thompson (mp=28)**, Morrison, SBU-YLin, WDM5/6/7, Goddard GCE | Aerosol-coupled Morrison (mp=40), NSSL, and the rest of the WRF MP tail (recognized, real-oracle or documented-boundary) | WRF-Chem |
| **PBL / sfc** | YSU, MYJ, MYNN-EDMF, ACM2, BouLac, GFS, GBM-TKE, MRF, **Shin-Hong (operational, TKE-diagnostic follow-up)**; MYNN-SL, revised-MM5, Pleim-Xiu, Janjic-Eta, NCEP-GFS sfclay | CAM-UW (`bl=9`); reference-only PBL tail (real oracle) | — |
| **Cumulus** | Kain-Fritsch, BMJ, Tiedtke (needs active flux-form moisture advection for RQVFTEN), Grell-Freitas (scale-aware) | New-Tiedtke + the reference-only/​documented-boundary CU tail (real oracle or named reason) | — |
| **Radiation** | RRTMG SW + LW with topographic shading + slope correction; Dudhia SW + classic RRTM LW (`ra_lw=1`); clear-sky `…C` flux diagnostics (opt-in) | Reference-only RA tail (real oracle); `ra_*={14,24}` compiled-out (BUILD-gated, like WRF) | — |
| **Land** | Noah classic, Noah-MP (prognostic), Pleim-Xiu LSM, thermal-diffusion slab | RUC LSM (reference-only, real oracle staged); **CLM4 (`sf_surface_physics=5`) / CTSM (`6`) — documented architecture boundary, fail-closed (no oracle claimed)** | Full Noah-MP snow-layer diagnostics in wrfout (KI-3) |
| **Nesting** | One-way live d01→d02→d03, per-domain subcycling, restart; GWD (`gwd_opt=1`) default-on on nested | — | Two-way feedback + radiation/w-relax in loop — finite/stable but 24 h equivalence untested (KI-11) |
| **Output** | Focused 104-variable `wrfout` (core met/spatial/vertical/soil + radiation-flux + Noah-MP snow-layer) | — | Full 375-variable wrfout; auxhist streams (KI-3) |
| **Multi-GPU** | `shard_map` + `lax.ppermute` halo sharding, single-GPU default = zero overhead; **experimental K2 domain-decomposition (default-OFF, periodic-BC only)** | — | Real multi-GPU throughput (needs DGX/NVLink; fake-mesh bit-identical only); K2 specified-BC not yet faithful |
| **Data assim.** | Lateral-BC relaxation | — | DFI, FDDA, grid/obs/spectral nudging |
| **Other** | — | — | Urban (BEP/BEM), lake, fully aerosol-coupled MP / WRF-Chem (rejected, not roadmap) |

These are **boundaries and a roadmap, not hidden gaps**: every unsupported
namelist selection is rejected before any compute with a specific named reason —
the port never silently substitutes or skips a scheme. The full per-scheme
classification is in the [Scheme triage](#scheme-triage--every-wrf-v4-scheme-classified)
below.

### GPU-operational physics menu (scan-wired, WRF-oracle-gated)

These are the schemes the operational scan actually dispatches; the wiring is in
[`src/gpuwrf/runtime/operational_mode.py`](src/gpuwrf/runtime/operational_mode.py)
(`_SCAN_WIRED_OPTIONS`) and
[`src/gpuwrf/coupling/scan_adapters.py`](src/gpuwrf/coupling/scan_adapters.py); the
namelist-accepted matrix is in
[`src/gpuwrf/contracts/physics_registry.py`](src/gpuwrf/contracts/physics_registry.py).

| Family | Namelist key | GPU-operational options (scan-wired) |
|---|---|---|
| Microphysics | `mp_physics` | 0 passive, 1 Kessler, 2 Purdue-Lin, 3 WSM3, 4 WSM5, 6 WSM6, 8 Thompson, 10 Morrison, 13 SBU-YLin, 14 WDM5, 16 WDM6, 24 WSM7, 26 WDM7, **28 aerosol-aware Thompson** (QNWFA/QNIFA prognostics; WRF-module oracle PASS), 97 Goddard GCE |
| PBL | `bl_pbl_physics` | 1 YSU, 2 MYJ (mandatory Janjic pairing), 3 GFS, 5 MYNN-EDMF (DMP mass flux + cloud-aware moisture/thermodynamics), 7 ACM2, 8 BouLac, 11 Shin-Hong, 12 GBM-TKE, 99 MRF |
| Surface layer | `sf_sfclay_physics` | 1 revised-MM5, 2 Janjic-Eta (paired with MYJ), 3 NCEP-GFS, 5 MYNN-SL, 7 Pleim-Xiu, 91 old-MM5 |
| Cumulus | `cu_physics` | 1 Kain-Fritsch, 2 BMJ (fp64), 3 Grell-Freitas (scale-aware), 6 Tiedtke, **16 New-Tiedtke** (v0.23; machine-precision JAX kernel vs pristine-WRF single-column oracle) — cu 6/16 need flux-form moisture advection for RQVFTEN |
| Radiation | `ra_sw_physics` / `ra_lw_physics` | RRTMG SW + LW (`=4`) with topo shading (`topo_shading=1`) + slope-corrected surface radiation (`slope_rad=1`); Dudhia SW (`ra_sw=1`) + classic RRTM LW (`ra_lw=1`); Held-Suarez idealized radiation (`ra_lw=31`); clear-sky `…C` flux diagnostics (opt-in) |
| Land surface | `sf_surface_physics` | 1 thermal-diffusion slab, 2 Noah classic (explicit static/land bundle), 4 Noah-MP (`use_noahmp=True`), 7 Pleim-Xiu LSM |
| Diffusion | `diff_opt`, `km_opt` | constant-K and 2-D Smagorinsky (incl. terrain-slope + map-factor deformation terms; WRF formula parity, max residual `3.78e-15`) |
| GWD | `gwd_opt` | 1 gravity-wave drag — **default-ON on the nested 1 km path** (`GPUWRF_GWD_NESTED=0` forces off) |
| Advection | `moist_adv_opt`, `scalar_adv_opt` | moisture flux-advection into RK3 + PD/monotonic moisture limiter (both opt-in, default-off = byte-identical) |

`mp_physics=0`, `bl_pbl_physics=0`, `sf_sfclay_physics=0`, `cu_physics=0`, and
`ra_*=0` are accepted as "disabled" slots.

### Scheme triage — every WRF v4 scheme classified

v0.18 closes the scheme gap by **classifying every WRF v4 namelist scheme** into
one of three buckets, with no scheme silently dropped (State = **67 leaves**, set-
union integrity proven across all family branches):

| Class | Count | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| **Operational** | **50** | Scan-wired into the GPU forecast loop, WRF-oracle-gated. (mp 15, cu 5, bl 10, sfclay 7, sf_surface 5, ra_lw 4, ra_sw 4) |
| **Reference-only-with-real-oracle** | **23** | A real WRF v4 scheme, validated against a real WRF oracle, **not** scan-wired; selecting it operationally **fails closed** with a named reason (never a silent fallback). (cu 9, bl 4, ra_lw 4, ra_sw 4, sf_surface 2) |
| **Documented-boundary / proven-irrelevant** | **33** | Recognized WRF option, **fail-closed** as a documented architecture boundary (e.g. CLM4/CTSM, CAM-UW) or proven-irrelevant tail. (mp 23, cu 3, ra_lw 2, ra_sw 2, sf_surface 2 [CLM4/CTSM], bl 1 [CAM-UW]) |

Proof object (set-union integrity, no-clobber, per-family counts):
[`proofs/v018/scheme_count_no_clobber.json`](proofs/v018/scheme_count_no_clobber.json)
(`checks.all_green=true`), independently re-verified by the v0.18 integration
critic ([`proofs/v018/integration_honesty_critic_opus.md`](proofs/v018/integration_honesty_critic_opus.md)).
The full per-code support table is in
[`docs/namelist-compatibility.md`](docs/namelist-compatibility.md).

**v0.23 extends this classification** (the v0.18 counts above are the historical
baseline): New-Tiedtke cumulus (`cu_physics=16`) graduates to **operational**
(machine-precision JAX kernel vs a pristine-WRF oracle), and Morrison-aerosol MP
(`mp=40`) joins **reference-only-with-real-oracle** (fp64 column kernel proven to
machine precision, but the prescribed AEROCU aerosol inputs have no operational
State substrate yet). NSSL 2-moment (`mp=18`), CAM-UW PBL (`bl_pbl_physics=9`),
urban BEP/BEM (`sf_urban_physics=2/3`) and the WRF lake model (`sf_lake_physics=1`)
are **reference-only / fail-closed** with staged oracles; their faithful ports are
tracked as their own milestones.

## Boundaries — what is NOT claimed

- **Not a universal WRF v4.** Standard regional ARW configs only; the common
  operational subset above. Every other scheme is classified
  (reference-only-with-oracle or documented-boundary) and fails closed with a named
  reason.
- **24 h/72 h forecast-skill equivalence is NOT closed — the credibility gate.**
  On the runnable equivalence demo (24 h d02), the verdict is `NOT_EQUIVALENT`:
  short-lead fields track CPU-WRF within tolerance, but by 24 h the run diverges,
  **dominated by lead-time wind divergence** (3D V pooled RMSE 8.13 m s⁻¹ vs a
  1.8 m s⁻¹ bar). PSFC is improved (707.8 → 415.3 Pa) but still out of bar, its
  residual driven by that same dynamical divergence. **Neither the winds nor PSFC
  are equivalent at 24 h.** Off-by-default fidelity levers (moisture flux-advection
  into RK3, MYJ+Janjic, clear-sky diagnostics) move toward this gap but do **not**
  close it — hard dynamics-`ph'` / MYNN / `*_tendf` GPU work, no cheap knob. This
  is the gate for any "operational / replacement" claim. See
  [docs/equivalence-demo.md](docs/equivalence-demo.md) (KI-9).
- **Cell-identity proof passes 9/10 with one bounded miss.** The Switzerland 72 h
  cell-identity proof closes with **9/10 hard-gate fields within frozen tolerance**
  and the dynamics/thermo core cell-for-cell identical; the one out-of-envelope
  field is accumulated `RAINNC` (**5.22 mm vs the 1.0 mm bound**, class-c). This is a
  derived accumulated-precip diagnostic with no expected forecast-skill impact,
  drawn **red** in the dashboard, **not** an identity failure; the frozen limit is
  unchanged (no goalpost moving, no tolerance widening). Proof:
  `proofs/v018/rainnc_qvapor_status.json`.
- **K2 multi-GPU is EXPERIMENTAL and default-OFF.** The K2 domain-decomposition
  path (`GPUWRF_K2_EXPERIMENTAL=1`) is **lab-tested only**: with the gate unset the
  default single-GPU graph is **bit-identical** (no collectives emitted,
  `proofs/v018/k2_flag_off_graph.json`). With the gate set, the **periodic-BC**
  decomposition reproduces the single-GPU reference **bit-for-bit at roundoff** on
  interior + internal shard seams — but the **physical (specified) boundary is NOT
  yet faithful** (periodic vs WRF specified BC diverge by design at the true domain
  edge; the boundary ring is *excluded* from the pass gate, not hidden behind a
  loosened tolerance). Do **not** enable K2 specified-BC multi-GPU for production.
  Proof: `proofs/v018/k2_multigpu_report.md`.
- **No statistical-equivalence (TOST) claim.** The cell-identity proof above
  **supersedes** the earlier TOST framing as the primary fidelity gate. The
  station-RMSE TOST campaign is underpowered at the available corpus (n=15;
  n≈27 for full power) and is **not run / not claimed**; deferred (KI-5).
- **Single-card speedup is measured but modest and scale-dependent.** v0.20.0
  default fused all-7 nesting is **~1.07× faster than v0.19 / ~1.53× faster than
  the same-box 12-rank CPU-WRF baseline** and **byte-identical to v0.19**, but on
  tiny single-domain geometries the GPU is **host/launch-bound and slower than
  CPU** (~2.3× slower at 129²). The tiny-nest all-7 is compute-bound at **~674
  s/forecast-hour**: **≥2× / 3× are NOT single-card reachable** and **fp32 cannot
  move it** (fp32 single-card speed ratio ≈0.91, INCONCLUSIVE-to-none). The
  remaining scale levers are **algorithmic + multi-GPU**, not broad fp32.
- **Multi-GPU throughput is PROJECTED, not measured.** An SPMD
  `shard_map` + collective-halo (`lax.ppermute`) foundation exists and is
  **bit-identity-validated on a fake/CPU mesh**, and the parametrized scaling
  harness lifts 1:1 to bigger GPUs — but this workstation has **one physical RTX
  5090**. Real multi-GPU throughput (e.g. one domain across a GB300-NVL72),
  NVLink/NCCL bandwidth, and collective overlap are **UNMEASURED**; the
  whole-Earth memory note stays **PROJECTED**. We do **not** claim it scales
  perfectly on GB300, and **no per-watt / per-kWh claim is made**.
- **Shin-Hong PBL (`bl_pbl_physics=11`) is operational with a TKE-diagnostic
  follow-up.** It is scan-wired and operational despite a ~28.5 % residual in the
  diagnostic TKE field, which was source-traced as **non-driving** (the dynamics
  tendencies never read it); the TKE-oracle upgrade is a documented follow-up, not
  a masked failure. See `proofs/v018/schemes_critic_opus.md`.
- **Not full two-way nesting.** One-way live nesting is proven over a 24–72 h
  window; the two-way feedback path is finite/stable but its 24 h real-GPU
  equivalence vs CPU-WRF is **untested** (KI-11).
- **fp32 is opt-in, capability/VRAM-only.** The standalone default path runs pure
  fp64 (byte-identical). The opt-in `mixed_perturb_fp32_v020` mode buys VRAM
  (−14.4%) and cell capability (~1.16×), **not** single-card speed (ratio ≈0.91),
  and its fidelity is verified only at the 1 h lead (24–120 h skill is future
  work).
- **Free-running open-lateral-boundary stability.** Free-running without
  lateral-boundary relaxation on wide domains (nx≈160+) can go unstable beyond
  ~14 h. The validated operational path uses boundary forcing (KI-7).
- **Apples-to-apples vs AceCAST is an EXPECTATION, not a benchmark.** No
  head-to-head run exists; see the [Performance](#apples-to-apples-vs-acecast-expectation--projected--not-measured)
  note. No competitive claim is made.
- **Not** DFI / FDDA / spectral-nudging / adaptive-Δt; **aerosol-coupled Morrison
  (`mp=40`) and NSSL fail closed**; **not urban (BEP/BEM) / lake / WRF-Chem /
  WRF-Fire / WRF-Hydro** (rejected, not roadmap).
- **v0.2.0 paper tag not formally re-released.** All prior releases remain
  accessible via git tags on the org repo; v0.2.0 stays accessible for paper claims.

A code-grounded, prioritized inventory of the remaining gap to a complete WRF v4
replacement lives in
[`docs/GPU_PORT_GAPS_TODO.md`](docs/GPU_PORT_GAPS_TODO.md) and the roadmap table
below.

## Roadmap — remaining work toward a complete WRF v4 port

> 🗺️ **Full port-completion roadmap:** every scheme/feature still reference-only,
> fail-closed, or out-of-scope — the 25 reference-only + 32 fail-closed physics codes, the
> 3-D turbulence closures (`km_opt=2/3/5` = 3-D TKE / 3-D Smagorinsky / SMS-3DTKE), data
> assimilation, coupled models, and output/grid gaps — is enumerated with a per-item "how to
> close it" in [`docs/PORT_COMPLETION_ROADMAP.md`](docs/PORT_COMPLETION_ROADMAP.md). Its
> explicit target is to drive the reference-only and fail-closed columns to zero. Regenerate the
> live status with `python -m gpuwrf.cli namelist-support`.

v0.18 is **feature-complete on scheme classification** — every WRF v4 namelist
scheme is operational, reference-only-with-oracle, or documented-boundary. What
remains is **fidelity, robustness, statistical closure, and performance/scale**, not
"missing schemes." Consolidated, prioritized ledger, sorted by importance for an
*optimal complete* port. Complexity: **S** ≈ 1–2 focused sprints · **M** ≈ 3–5 ·
**L** ≈ 5–10 · **XL** ≈ 10+.

| 1 | **24 h/72 h forecast-skill closure (T2/U10/V10)** — the credibility gate; cell-identity proven, broad skill-equivalence open. Hard dynamics-`ph'`/MYNN/`*_tendf` work. | L | KI-9; docs/equivalence-demo.md |
| 2 | **RAINNC bounded accumulated-precip residual** — 5.22 mm RMSE vs 1.0 mm bound (class-c, no skill impact expected); diffuse Thompson staging + coupled accumulated-precip propagation, no single bounded missing process. | M | `proofs/v018/rainnc_qvapor_status.json` |
| 3 | **MYNN PBL completeness** — EDMF mass flux wired; `icloud_bl=1` cloud PDF and `cloudmix` partial. Tied to the residual near-surface wind-skill gap. | M | GPU_PORT_GAPS P1-4 |
| 4 | **Shin-Hong PBL TKE-diagnostic** — operational; diagnostic TKE field ~28.5 % residual (non-driving, source-traced); oracle upgrade follow-up. | S | `proofs/v018/schemes_critic_opus.md` |
| 5 | **Moisture advection into RK3 + cadence fidelity** — wired opt-in (default-off); cadence refinements + operationalizing on the default path remain. | M | GPU_PORT_GAPS P1-6; KI-10 |
| 6 | **RRTMG SW taug top-layer convention fix** — 4 UV bands fail intermediate oracle; tier-1 fluxes faithful; pre-existing. | S | KI-6 |
| **Tier 2 — nesting / output completeness** | | | |
| 7 | **Full multi-domain nested equivalence** — 24 h one-way proven; two-way feedback + radiation-in-loop + w relaxation + 5-domain long-run equivalence remain (2-way 24 h real-GPU equivalence untested). | L | GPU_PORT_GAPS P0-1; KI-11 |
| 8 | **Full `wrfout` variable coverage** — focused 104-variable writer vs WRF's 375. Blocks downstream tools. | M | GPU_PORT_GAPS P0-5; KI-3 |
| **Tier 3 — correctness / robustness debts** | | | |
| 9 | **Free-running open-lateral-boundary stability** — wide domains (nx≈160+) can blow up without boundary relaxation beyond ~14 h. | M | KI-7 |
| 10 | **U10 episodic under-prediction** — final-lead breach on the validated d02 case (tied to MYNN cloud PDF). | S–M | KI-4 |
| 11 | **CLM4/CTSM land-surface** — documented architecture boundary (fail-closed, no oracle); a faithful port needs the CLM/CTSM column model, a v1.0 boundary. | XL | `proofs/v018/lsm_family_status.json` |
| **Tier 4 — statistical / release closure** | | | |
| 12 | **Powered n≈27 TOST scoring** — corpus prepared, not scored; superseded as the primary gate by cell-identity but still a paper-equivalence item. | S–M | KI-5; ADR-029 |
| 13 | **v0.2.0 stable paper-release tag** — intended stable baseline never formally re-tagged. | S | `V0.2.0-PLAN.md` |
| **Tier 5 — performance / scale** | | | |
| 14 | **Real multi-GPU throughput** — K2 domain-decomposition periodic-BC bit-exact (experimental, default-off); specified-BC decomposition not yet faithful; DGX/NVLink cluster required for real throughput. | L | `proofs/v018/k2_multigpu_report.md`; `contracts/halo.py` |
| 15 | **fp32-physics islands fast-mode** — compact explicit-fp64-island restructuring (~1.5–1.6×, still < 2×) as an optional fast-mode. | XL | `proofs/v016/fp32_verdict/` |
| **Tier 6 — breadth beyond the wired set** | | | |
| 16 | **Scan-wire the reference-only-with-oracle tail** — 23 schemes validated against a real oracle but fail-closed operationally; wiring each is incremental. | XL | `proofs/v018/scheme_count_no_clobber.json` |
| 17 | **FDDA / grid+obs / spectral nudging** — none (only lateral-BC relaxation). | M–XL | GPU_PORT_GAPS P1-1 |
| 18 | **Map-projection / grid generality** — Lambert/Mercator/Polar + hybrid-eta C-grid only; no moving/global nests. | M | GPU_PORT_GAPS P2-1 |

**Critical path to a *complete operational* port:** item **1** (skill closure) is
the gate; **2–6** are the highest-value fidelity levers (where the remaining
wind/T2 skill lives); **7–8** complete nesting + output; the perf/scale items
(14–15) and breadth (16–18) are real but lower-leverage than the skill + fidelity
tier.

## Core goals (immutable)

1. **GPU-native architecture.** Whole-state device residency after init. No
   host/device transfers inside the timestep loop without an ADR. Fused
   timestep-scale kernels, not micro-kernel launch storms.
2. **Operational skill parity with CPU WRF v4** on Canary L2/L3 cases — proven
   cell-for-cell on the dynamics/thermo core; 24–72 h T2/U10/V10 forecast-skill
   equivalence is the open credibility gate.
3. **Performance vs CPU WRF** on the same workstation, re-certified after every
   correctness fix (no stale speedup claims). The headline is the
   command-to-finish wall-clock ratio; kernel-level ratios are reported separately.
4. **Validation against WRF, not bitwise reproducibility.** Tiered pyramid: micro
   fixture / savepoint parity → physical invariants → short-run / convergence →
   cell-identity proof against CPU-WRF.
5. **Forkable and auditable.** Every claim has a proof object on disk. Every
   architecture decision has an ADR with cross-model review.

## Known issues (current as of v0.23.1)

Full detail with symptom / ruled-out / workaround / follow-up in
**[KNOWN_ISSUES.md](KNOWN_ISSUES.md)**. The release carries only the
items below; everything resolved in prior releases is dropped. Two former entries
no longer apply in v0.21.0: the all-7 9-domain nest now runs **finite through the
old step-67 divergence window** (dycore boundary-stability fix), and a warm start
is no longer a multi-tens-of-minutes re-lower (the AOT cheap-key warm-start loads
the compiled executable in seconds).

| ID | Summary | Severity |
|---|---|---|
| **Extreme-terrain ceiling (> ~6000 m)** | The Alpine / Mont-Blanc extreme-terrain boundary instability is **fixed in v0.21.1** (standalone-root specified-boundary cadence + WRF-faithful zero-gradient physical-`W`; d01 max `|W|` bounded over the proof window, no masking). The **remaining ceiling is ~6000 m**: a 2-nest over ~8000 m terrain (Karakoram) still diverges to a non-finite state that the **default-on finite guard catches and fails closed** (0 bad frames written), and WRF's own `real.exe` likewise fails on this terrain without a lowered `etac`. The deep > 6000 m fix is a **future dycore-boundary milestone**, not a point patch; the production envelope is steep real-world terrain up to ~6000 m. | Documented terrain ceiling |
| **#123 solo-fragmentation OOM** | The **co-resident-headroom** OOM mode is **SOLVED** by the launch-time VRAM preflight (GPU-validated fail-closed exit 75 + healthy-card happy path). The **solo `cuda_async` fragmentation** mode is **MITIGATED, not fixed**: the bit-identical 1024 RRTMG column-tile cap cuts the transient's largest allocation **0.432 → 0.271 GiB (−37 %, GPU-measured)**, but solo fragmentation **can still OOM the full fp64 nest**, and the long-horizon 9-nest can still OOM around the ~90 min integration horizon (a reproducer is shipped). v0.21.0 adds a **default-on fail-fast finite guard** (`GPUWRF_FINITE_CHECK`) so a corrupted state aborts cleanly with `{domain, field, level, step, sim-time, index}` instead of propagating. **No OOM-proof / fp32-nest / 24 h large-nest claim.** | Mitigated + carried limitation |
| **fp32 1 h-only fidelity** | The opt-in fp32 mode (`mixed_perturb_fp32_v020`) is tolerance-checked **only at the 1 h lead** (19/19 fields green) — real but **not stringent**; the **24–120 h skill gate is future work, out of scope**. fp64 stays the byte-identical default. | Documented scope |
| **High resident host RAM (~36 GB)** | A run holds **~36 GB of host RAM** resident even at only ~9.6 GB VRAM, because the Noah-MP/physics constant tables are currently baked into the compiled executable (static aux) rather than passed as runtime arguments. This is **precision-independent** and **does not affect correctness, single-run stability, or results** — but it limits running two instances on a 64 GB box and reduces large-grid / pod-density headroom. Root-caused; the tables-as-runtime-args fix is **still deferred (not in v0.21.0)**. | Root-caused, deferred |
| **fp32 mixed-precision OOMs on the deep all-7 nest** | The opt-in fp32 mode is **single-domain / capability-only**; on the full all-7 9-domain nest it can OOM on the recurring RRTMG radiation transient (allocator fragmentation) and is **~5× slower than fp64 there anyway**. The nest default is **fp64 + `cuda_async`**, which is bounded (~12.6 GB peak); the v0.20.1 preflight + 1024 RRTMG cap **reduce but do not eliminate** the solo-fragmentation OOM. fp32-on-nest remains **out of scope**. | Documented scope; fp64 nest unaffected |
| **RAINNC residual** | Accumulated `RAINNC` is **5.22 mm RMSE vs the 1.0 mm bound** (class-c) on the Switzerland 72 h cell-identity proof — a bounded, derived accumulated-precip diagnostic with **no expected forecast-skill impact**; **no tolerance widening**, drawn red. Diffuse Thompson staging + coupled accumulated-precip propagation; no single bounded missing process. | Bounded acceptance |
| **CLM4/CTSM boundary** | CLM4 (`sf_surface_physics=5`) / CTSM (`6`) are a **documented architecture boundary** — recognized, **fail-closed** with a named reason, **no oracle claimed**. A faithful port needs the CLM/CTSM column model; a v1.0 boundary. | Scope boundary |
| **K2 multi-GPU experimental** | The K2 domain-decomposition path is **EXPERIMENTAL, default-OFF, lab-only**: periodic-BC bit-exact on interior + shard seams, **physical specified-BC not yet faithful** (boundary ring excluded from the pass gate, not hidden). Default single-GPU graph bit-identical (no collectives). Not for production. | Experimental |
| **Shin-Hong PBL11 TKE** | Shin-Hong (`bl_pbl_physics=11`) is operational despite a ~28.5 % diagnostic-TKE residual, source-traced as **non-driving** (dynamics tendencies never read it); TKE-oracle upgrade is a documented follow-up. | Documented follow-up |
| **CPU suite xfail debt** | The full CPU test suite carries **38 documented non-strict xfail tests**, all **pre-existing** (each fails identically on tag `v0.17.0`; **zero v0.18-introduced regressions**, verified). They run and surface an XPASS if they start passing. Triage + per-test disposition: [`proofs/v018/suite_triage.md`](proofs/v018/suite_triage.md). | Carried test-debt |
| **KI-9** | **The credibility gate.** Cell-identity proven (dynamics/thermo core cell-for-cell), but the broader **24 h/72 h forecast-skill equivalence** is open — equivalence demo 24 h d02 `NOT_EQUIVALENT`, dominated by **lead-time wind divergence** (3D V pooled RMSE 8.13 m/s). Hard dynamics-`ph'`/MYNN/`*_tendf` GPU work, no cheap knob. | Documented gap |
| **Fused fast-path caveat** | The default fused all-7 nesting is **~1.53× faster than 12-rank CPU-WRF / ~1.07× faster than v0.19 (byte-identical to v0.19)** and all-fields tolerance-green, but it is tolerance-green rather than bitwise-vs-eager and still pays a **one-time cold compile** on the very first run. In v0.21.0 a fresh process then warm-loads the compiled executable in seconds via the default-on AOT cheap-key warm-start (no multi-tens-of-minutes re-lower). Use `GPUWRF_BITWISE=1` or `GPUWRF_NESTED_FUSE=0` for eager bitwise/debug comparisons. | Carried caveat |
| **KI-4** | d02 **U10** episodic final-lead under-prediction (8.06 m/s vs 7.5 m/s bar); within bar at all other leads, beats persistence 23/24. Tied to KI-9. | Documented residual |
| **KI-3** | Operational `wrfout` is a focused **104-variable** subset (vs WRF's 375). | Scope boundary |
| **KI-5** | Powered TOST campaign not run; **superseded by cell-identity as the primary gate**. No TOST PASS claimed. | Scope boundary |
| **KI-6** | RRTMG SW intermediate `taug` top-layer convention differs in 4 UV bands; integrated fluxes pass tier-1 (< 0.05% rel). Pre-existing. | Isolated |
| **KI-7** | Free-running (`run_boundary=False`) on **wide domains** (nx≈160+) can go unstable beyond ~14 h. Validated path uses boundary forcing. | Robustness edge |
| **KI-10** | Moisture-advection cadence refinements (opt-in path; physics-tendency folding not yet WRF-cadence-exact). Default-off → no shipped-behavior impact. | Fidelity refinement |
| **KI-11** | 2-way nesting equivalence vs CPU-WRF untested (only finite/stable proven). | Scope boundary |
