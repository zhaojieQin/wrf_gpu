# Known Issues — v0.23.4

## v0.23.4 carried limitations

- **Nested radiation cadence:** the nested pipeline targets a fixed 30-minute
  interval instead of honoring arbitrary namelist `radt`. The one-hour
  nine-domain gate is accepted, but this limits longer-horizon radiation-fidelity
  claims.
- **Nested terrain radiation:** `topo_shading=1` and `slope_rad=1` currently
  bind disabled in the nested runtime. This is documented future work, not an
  active v0.23.4 capability.
- **Single-domain daily advection binding:** the accepted nested path honors
  `moist_adv_opt`/`scalar_adv_opt`, but the single-domain daily pipeline
  currently drops requested values and runs `0/0`. Operators must disclose the
  effective behavior rather than claiming the requested limiter ran.
- **Acoustic substep / dry-mass mismatch:** when `time_step_sound` is omitted,
  pristine WRF derives 4 acoustic substeps on the tracked fixture while the
  current runtime selects 10. A four-substep discriminator improved the initial
  interior U/V result but did not pass the terminal comparison; the residual
  dry-mass behavior remains unresolved and the default is unchanged.
- **Broad 24-72 hour skill:** v0.23.4 passes its specific 24-hour SP2 chain and
  one-hour nine-nest fixtures; seasonal/configuration-independent forecast-skill
  equivalence remains open.
- **Thompson follow-ups:** static `NSED_MAX=16` can silently cap demanded
  sedimentation substeps, and widespread exact-zero carried Ni remains
  unexplained. Both need separate future contracts; neither was changed here.
- **AOT cache-key fragmentation:** fused-phase shape and namespace-specific
  terrain provenance can miss an otherwise reusable executable key. The safe
  result is a recompile; this is compile/warm-start debt, not a numerical
  workaround.

## Resolved in v0.23.4

- The SP2 mass-flux seam, S2 child-boundary retention, V/V10 moist/scalar
  transport ordering, and Thompson late-Ni mass/number balance are closed in one
  linear correctness chain. The terminal all-physics d01-d09 fixture writes
  27/27 outputs; all 177,497,511 numeric values are finite and all 9 × 102
  compared fields pass the frozen gates.

## v0.23.4 (prepared, pending publication) — d03 performance regression, understood, not fixed

- **Symptom:** 3-domain (`maxdom3`) and 9-domain configurations that engage `d03` run
  measurably slower than v0.23.3 — production-faithful measurement: v0.23.3
  **1.9668543059 s/root-step** vs the v0.23.4 candidate **2.9831176877 s/root-step**
  (**ratio 1.516694795, a 51.67% regression**). 2-domain (d01+d02) configurations are
  unaffected (measured 0.960–1.018×, no regression).
- **Ruled out:** not a measurement artifact (a canary-harness reload-cost confound was
  found and excluded via a production-faithful re-measurement using the real
  `execute_nested_pipeline` entry point); not a scalar-batching dispatch defect (the
  dispatch-level fix that made this regression's root cause visible is itself bit-exact
  and WRF-fidelity-clean on a long-horizon gate; it fixed a real but secondary dispatch
  cost, not the dominant one); not scheduling/fusion overhead (a B1/B2/B3 architecture
  retest closed with zero additional GPU time — the current default already issues an
  identical dispatch sequence to the alternative it was compared against).
- **Root cause:** a CPU component profile localized the added cost to inside the FCT
  flux-limiter kernel's own flux-renormalization computation — 79.95% of the d03
  activation cost increment is inside the limiter call itself, which is 5.237x slower
  than the unlimited path on only 1.087x more HLO operations but 2.188x more estimated
  bytes accessed and 1.903x more FLOPs (a memory-traffic/lowering inefficiency in the
  kernel, not a dispatch or batching-width problem).
- **Workaround:** none needed for 2-domain (d01+d02) use cases (unaffected). For
  3-domain/9-domain d03 use cases, expect roughly 1.5x the v0.23.3 wall-clock until this
  closes; there is no configuration flag that avoids the cost while still running d03.
- **Follow-up:** a dedicated kernel-optimization sprint
  (`worker/gpt/v0234-fct-limiter-optimization`) tested the known source-level
  levers. Three fusion-boundary-control techniques were tried and cleanly falsified (an
  `optimization_barrier` insertion that XLA saw through; a `lax.map`/`scan`
  restructuring with a real numerical divergence, and separately re-adjudicated on CPU
  performance grounds — 1.115x slower, not adopted; disabling XLA's multi-output-fusion
  pass, which broke the diagnosed mega-fusion but made runtime *worse*, refuting a
  register-pressure theory of the regression). The roll-substitution candidate passed
  a small single-shape safety check but was rejected at production scale: it failed the
  exact-output gate and remained 38.9% slower than v0.23.3. A follow-up Nsight Compute
  hardware measurement of the isolated dominant kernel then settled the open bound
  question: **occupancy/latency-bound, not memory-bandwidth-bound** (DRAM throughput
  20.3% of peak, achieved occupancy 15.6%, register-limited to 2 of 24 possible
  concurrent blocks). This rules out a reduced-precision fix and identifies concurrent
  sibling-domain scheduling as the mechanistically-mapped next lever — design-scoped in
  `RANK6_SIBLING_SCHEDULING_DESIGN.md`, not implemented or validated, no established
  delivery schedule. **The investigation is closed; this regression ships as a known,
  understood limitation, not an open blocker.** Full trail:
  `.agent/decisions/VERSION-SPRINT-LEDGER.md` (2026-07-22 through 2026-07-24 entries),
  `RELEASE_NOTES_v0.23.4.md`.

## Resolved in v0.19.0

- **All-7 nested speed gate was host-orchestration-bound.** The fori-loop
  `_advance_chunk` restore alone was still slower than the 12-rank CPU baseline;
  v0.19.0 ships the fused nested cascade default-on and measures **713
  s/forecast-hour warm** vs **1020 s/forecast-hour CPU** (**1.43x faster**).
  Proof: `proofs/v019/release_prep/gate_summary.json`.
- **Nested terrain/base-state blend mismatch.** Runtime nest initialization now
  matches WRF's terrain/base-state blend path, closing the HGT/MUB/PB/PHB red
  class on nests and enabling the all-fields gate: all 9 domains PASS the
  established grid comparator, **102 compared numeric fields/domain**, **0
  tolerance failures**. Proof:
  `proofs/v019/release_prep/grid_compare_summary.json`.

## v0.19 carried caveat

- **Default fused mode is tolerance-green, not bitwise-vs-eager, and has a large
  one-time compile.** The first all-7 fused run pays a large XLA compile (about
  41 min wall on the reference system, cached after). Use `GPUWRF_BITWISE=1` or
  `GPUWRF_NESTED_FUSE=0` for eager bitwise/debug comparisons.

## Resolved in v0.18.3

- **`--max-dom 9` (all-7-island nest) compile blowup.** `jit__advance_chunk`
  compiled forever (never integrated) because Thompson sedimentation scans
  materialized static `s64[nz]` index arrays that XLA constant-folded unbounded
  across the 9 domain shapes. Fixed by threading scalar `int32` scan counters
  (bit-identical): all 9 domain-shape compiles now bounded (≤409 s cold / ≤22 s
  warm), integration stable (~85 % util), output written. Proof:
  `proofs/v018/maxdom9_fix/report.md`.
- **Nested output ignored `history_interval`.** The nested pipeline hardcoded
  hourly output; it now honors the namelist per-domain `history_interval` (hourly
  gates unchanged). Proof: d03 `wrfout` at forecast +5 min (`XTIME=5.0`).


Honest, code-grounded list of what is open or bounded. Each entry states the
symptom, the current understanding, the workaround, and the tracked follow-up.
No spin. The deeper per-issue history (KI-1…KI-11, including resolved items) is in
[`docs/KNOWN_ISSUES.md`](docs/KNOWN_ISSUES.md); the v0.15 release-gate detail is
retained verbatim below the v0.18 section.

## Resolved in v0.18.2

- **1 km nested all-island VRAM/OOM path.** The prior AC1_FIT 9/3/1 nested 1 km
  path OOMed near **31.8/32 GiB** and failed a **12.72 GiB** contiguous-arena
  request plus recurring **2.09 GiB** allocations. v0.18.2 resolves this with
  bit-identical RRTMG radiation column tiling (**16384→2048**) plus tiled MYNN
  cold-start BouLac initialization: warm-cache 1-forecast-hour run PASS,
  **18.1 GiB peak VRAM**, 26/26 `wrfout` fields exact (`max_abs_diff=0.0`).
  Proof: `proofs/v018/oom_fix/fix_report.md`.

## v0.18 carried items (this release)

- **RAINNC bounded accumulated-precip residual.** Accumulated grid-scale precip is
  an operationally-bounded diagnostic. The v0.18 RAINNC/QVAPOR work is accepted as
  class-c with a measured **5.22 mm RMSE** vs the 1.0 mm atlas bound — **no
  tolerance widening**, judged no forecast-skill impact by decision. A
  precipitation-placement sensitivity, not a dynamics blow-up. Proof:
  `proofs/v018/rainnc_qvapor_status.json`. (Continuation of the v0.15 RAINNC KI.)
- **CLM4 (`sf_surface_physics=5`) / CTSM (`6`) — documented architecture boundary,
  fail-closed.** Not registry-accepted; `oracle_path=None` (no oracle claimed); the
  registry rejects them and the catalog lists them in the recognized fail-closed
  table. A deliberate v1.0 scope boundary, not a silent gap. Proof:
  `proofs/v018/lsm_family_status.json`.
- **K2 multi-GPU specified-BC — EXPERIMENTAL, default-OFF.** The K2 domain-decomp
  lane is periodic-only-faithful; **specified-BC is NOT faithful** (boundary ring
  excluded from the pass gate; a prior tolerance-widening was reverted). Default-off
  is proven (no collectives emitted: `proofs/v018/k2_flag_off_graph.json`). Do not
  enable specified-BC multi-GPU for production. Proof: `proofs/v018/k2_multigpu_report.md`.
- **PBL11 Shin-Hong TKE-diagnostic follow-up.** Shin-Hong is operational despite a
  28.5 % TKE-diagnostic residual: the TKE/EL fields are source-traced as
  non-driving (dynamics tendencies never read them), `tke_diagnostic_exact_pass`
  is surfaced (not masked), and a TKE-oracle upgrade is the tracked follow-up. The
  operational promotion is justified on the driving fields. Detail:
  `proofs/v018/schemes_critic_opus.md` §1.

### Carried CPU-suite test-debt (pre-existing on v0.17; honest xfail, not silent RED)

The full CPU test suite on this workstation carries **38 xfailed tests** (36
newly converted by the v0.18 triage + 2 pre-existing), all
**pre-existing** (each fails identically on tag `v0.17.0`; none is a
v0.18-introduced regression — verified). They are converted to documented
**non-strict xfail** (registry: `tests/conftest.py::_PREEXISTING_CPU_XFAILS`;
full table + reasons: `proofs/v018/suite_triage.md`). Each test still RUNS — an
unexpected pass surfaces as XPASS — and **no assertion was deleted or loosened**.
The three categories:

- **ENV (host environment).** External single-column WRF Fortran harnesses
  (MYNN/RRTMG/Thompson), warmed `nsys` traces, the read-only Gen2 corpus, the
  paper publication-audit corpus, and the agentos skill-evals corpus are not all
  present on a plain CPU checkout; plus three byte-/bitwise-identity checks
  (`test_v013_{mrf,myj}_operational` default-suite, `test_v015_stream_a_bitwise`)
  that are non-deterministic only on the **XLA:CPU AOT** path (machine-feature
  mismatch, `+prefer-no-gather`/SIGILL warnings) and are bit-stable on the GPU
  operational backend.
- **GPU-NUM (GPU-native numeric oracle on the CPU backend).** The m6b4/m6b5
  acoustic/dycore savepoint-parity and m6b0r `calc_coef_w` top-row oracles, the
  m6x ADR-023 MPAS-slice RMSE and `c2_metrics` identity, and the step-46
  v-runaway bound run on the CPU backend against fixtures that target the GPU
  operational hydrostatic path (the idealized fixtures predate the F7
  hydrostatic-column requirement and hit NaN on the CPU vertical-solver path).
  The operational GPU forecast is unaffected; the GPU-lock suite is green.
- **STALE (assertion pins a superseded value/source/design).** HaloSpec
  width-rejection rule, init-allocator allowlist, the all-fp64 precision-registry
  expectation (fp32 fields now exist), refactored operational/acoustic source
  strings, the theta-guard per-level ceiling (700→450 K), the default MYNN
  condensation `niter` (50→16, documented shipped default), and drifted
  stabilizer-count / scout-snapshot / boundary-replay baselines. These should be
  updated to the current shipped values in a follow-up test-maintenance sprint.

Nine other previously-RED tests were **fixed to green** this triage (not
carried): the three operational `device_get` source guards (made loop-precise —
the v0.18 `_assert_nonzero_initial_mu_total` host pull is a verified OUT-OF-LOOP
one-time pre-flight check, not a hot-loop transfer), the two `m7_1km_memory_audit`
tests (audit now sizes all 67 State leaves), the two `wsm_sm_savepoint_parity`
path-form checks (expanduser), and the two `v013_compile_perf2` recompile-hygiene
tests (cleared global JAX caches to remove a test-order artifact).

**Proof-artifact hygiene.** 18 committed proof JSONs that the suite previously
re-wrote with fp/path/timing noise on every run are now write-gated
(`GPUWRF_WRITE_PROOFS=1` or a tmp `out=`/`--proof-dir`); the canonical proofs are
unchanged and the worktree ends clean after a full suite run. Detail:
`proofs/v018/suite_triage.md`.

### Resolved in v0.18 (was a regression risk, fixed in code — not carried)

- **Thompson warm-process graupel-melt fidelity (m5 WRF mass oracle).** Accepted
  commit `044bb65a` (cold-process fidelity) bundled a finer diagnostic
  graupel-number distribution without WRF's sparse-graupel `N0_melt` melt override
  (module_mp_thompson.F:2802-2806), under-melting warm-cell graupel (spurious
  `qg≈5e-7` where WRF melts to 0), and added rci/sci ice-collection without WRF's
  `if(temp<T_0)` cold gate (line 2554). Both were transcribed from pristine WRF;
  the warm-process oracle (`tests/test_m5_thompson_process_residuals.py`) is now
  bit-exact and the cold-process gain is preserved (cold-collection oracle GREEN).
  **Fixed, not a carried tolerance.** Detail: `proofs/v018/integration_report.md`
  → "Honesty-fix closeout".

# Known Issues — v0.15.0 (retained release-gate detail)

Honest, code-grounded list of what was open or bounded in the v0.15 release. Each
entry states the symptom, the current understanding, the workaround, and the
tracked follow-up. No spin. The deeper per-issue history (KI-1…KI-11, including
resolved items) is in [`docs/KNOWN_ISSUES.md`](docs/KNOWN_ISSUES.md).

> **Release framing.** v0.15 is a **kernel-architecture + WRF-fidelity** release,
> **not** an end-to-end speedup release. It delivers the project's final fp64 GPU
> kernel (adversarially confirmed near-optimal, device-bound), the MYNN-EDMF
> condensation `niter` 50 → 16 + Thompson cold-collection WRF-fidelity fixes, the
> MUB/PB nest-base-state seam fix, and re-closes both 72 h GPU-vs-CPU-WRF
> field-parity gates (Switzerland d01 + Canary L2 d02) with the reproducible
> identity-proof plot system ([`docs/IDENTITY_PROOF.md`](docs/IDENTITY_PROOF.md)).
> Performance is honestly **~parity total-wall** (0.99×/1.04×), forecast-only
> ~1.05–1.20×; **no multi-× and no large-grid speedup is claimed.** The honest
> numbers are below.

## Final-gate verdicts (both gates re-closed on the final v0.15 code)

- **Switzerland d01 72 h field-parity gate:** stable to h72; **9/10 prognostic
  fields within frozen tolerance**, dynamics/thermo/mass all green; **1 atlas
  tolerance failure** (vs v0.14's 3). The single Grid-Delta Atlas hard-gate miss
  is **RAINNC rmse 5.08 mm vs the 1.0 mm bound** (bounded precip sensitivity;
  cold-collection moved it −15 % from v0.14's 5.99 mm). DZS/ZS now PASS paired.
  Run `v015_switzerland_d01_72h_gpu_finalgates_20260613T094842Z` vs CPU truth
  `v014_switzerland_72h_cpu_20260610T122909Z`; **total-wall GPU 2941 s vs CPU
  2906 s ≈ 0.99× (forecast-only ~1.20×)**, peak VRAM **22.9 GiB** (up from
  v0.14's 20.5 GiB). Proof: `proofs/v015/finalgates/switzerland_d01/`.
- **Canary L2 d02 72 h field-parity gate:** stable to h72; operational verdict
  **L2_D02_GREEN** (bounds PASS, rmse PASS, pipeline green); **9/10 prognostic
  fields within frozen tolerance**; **1 atlas tolerance failure** (vs v0.14's 3).
  The lone bounded Atlas miss is **QVAPOR rmse 1.44×10⁻³ vs 1.0×10⁻³ kg/kg**
  (+44%, **no regression** from v0.14's 1.45×10⁻³). The v0.14 **MUB/PB**
  nest-frame-seam statics are now **fixed** (250.7 → 0.0078 Pa). Run
  `v015_canary_d02_72h_gpu_finalgates_20260613T095113Z` vs CPU truth
  `20260501_18z_l2_72h_20260519T173026Z`; **total-wall GPU 8414 s vs CPU ~8713 s
  ≈ 1.04× (forecast-only ~1.05×)**, peak VRAM **29.8 GiB** (up from v0.14's
  21.1 GiB — a disclosed regression). Proof: `proofs/v015/finalgates/canary_l2_d02/`.

## Bounded acceptances (honest, with their numeric justification)

These fields are **bounded-not-exact**: operationally acceptable but not painted
as bitwise-exact channels. They are drawn red (never green) when they breach
their envelope in the identity-proof plots.

- **KI — RAINNC bounded precipitation sensitivity.** Accumulated grid-scale
  precipitation is an operationally-bounded diagnostic with a 1.0 mm RMSE
  envelope. On the final Switzerland d01 72 h v0.15 run it sat at **5.08 mm RMSE**
  (out of the 1.0 mm bound) — a precipitation-placement sensitivity, not a
  dynamics blow-up; the full dynamics/thermodynamics core stayed within envelope.
  v0.15 **Thompson cold-collection** moved it −15 % from v0.14's 5.99 mm; the
  RAINNC WRF-convention bug (snow + graupel + ice were dropped from the
  accumulation) was FIXED in v0.14. Per-cell/number refinement → v0.16.
- **KI — Canary QVAPOR bounded.** 3D water-vapour mixing ratio carries a tight
  1.0×10⁻³ kg/kg envelope. On the final Canary L2 d02 72 h v0.15 run it was
  marginal at **1.44×10⁻³ kg/kg (+44%)** — **no regression** from v0.14's
  1.45×10⁻³ (MYNN marine entrainment-depth class; surface flux exonerated).
  Carried → v0.16 stability lane.
- **KI — Canary MUB/PB nest-frame-seam base-state artifact (FIXED in v0.15).**
  v0.14's static base-state mass (`MUB`)/base pressure (`PB`) nest-frame-seam
  artifact (Atlas max_abs MUB 250.7 / PB 249.9) is **fixed in v0.15** — the nest
  now packs its own static base ring (WRF never forces nest base state). On the
  final Canary L2 d02 72 h v0.15 run MUB/PB max_abs is **0.0078 Pa**. Resolved.
- **KI — GRAUPELNC source-fidelity gap.** Accumulated graupel has a microphysics
  source-fidelity gap vs CPU-WRF (the same Thompson parity debts tracked under
  KI-4 in `docs/KNOWN_ISSUES.md`: snow fall-speed approximation, cloud-water
  sedimentation, invalid-column fallback). Bounded; tracked, not a dynamics
  issue.

## Scope boundaries (deliberate, not silent gaps)

- **KI-3 — focused wrfout writer field subset.** The operational writer emits a
  focused **104-variable** `wrfout` (core met/spatial/vertical/soil + radiation
  flux + Noah-MP snow-layer) vs WRF's 375. Missing fields are stochastic-seed
  arrays and less-common diagnostics. Full 375-variable coverage is deferred.
- **KI — tier3_coupled double-count.** The tier-3 coupled validation aggregation
  can double-count a contribution in one path; this is a reporting/aggregation
  caveat in the validation tooling, not a forecast-state error. The per-field
  gate numbers (the identity-proof scoreboard and the grid-delta atlas) are the
  authoritative parity evidence and are not affected.

## Performance

- **KI — ~parity total-wall; fp64 kernel near-optimal (the lever is fp32-operational).**
  v0.15 is **not** an end-to-end speedup release: total-wall is ~parity
  (Switzerland 0.99×, Canary 1.04×), forecast-only ~1.05–1.20×. The fp64 GPU
  kernel is **adversarially confirmed near-optimal without megakernels** — the
  step is **device-bound** (~4 % idle), every host-side lever (whole-step
  CUDA-graph capture, denominator hoist, scan-unrolls) is shipped or proven
  wall-neutral, and cuSPARSE PCR + column tiling are already live. The per-step
  MYNN-condensation `niter` 50 → 16 win (~1.4× isolated) dilutes to forecast-only
  ~1.05–1.20× in the full pipeline. **No multi-× / large-grid speedup is claimed**
  (the prior "6–10× per-cell at large grids" framing is **refuted** by the
  project's own `km_bench`: per-cell cost slightly worsens; honest large-grid
  asymptote ~1.6×). Evidence: `proofs/perf/v015/kernel_characterization.md`.
- **KI — opt-in fp32-BouLac (~1.67×) blocked by a compile pathology.** fp32-BouLac
  and an O(nz) BouLac memory win are proven correct in isolation (WRF oracles to
  machine epsilon) but hit an XLA mixed-precision "very-slow-compile" pathology in
  the full forecast jit; they ship as **opt-in flags** (`GPUWRF_MYNN_BOULAC_FP32`,
  `GPUWRF_MYNN_BOULAC_ONZ`), default off.
- **KI — higher peak VRAM (a v0.15 regression).** Peak VRAM rose vs v0.14
  (Switzerland 20.5 → 22.9 GiB, Canary 21.1 → 29.8 GiB) from the `niter`-16
  unrolled temporaries + larger nested arena. The intrinsic ~21.7 GiB fp64 dycore
  working set is the binding 1 km ceiling; the deferred fp32-operational
  restructuring ~halves the dycore arena.

## Precision

- **KI — fp32 operational-state restructuring is the named next major lever.** The
  standalone CLI path is fp64-only; gated-fp32 remains an experimental ADR-007
  preview. The **fp32-operational-state restructuring (ADR-007 / ADR-031)** is the
  **single** structural fix for both the genuine speedup (the opt-in fp32-BouLac
  ~1.67× lands once the mixed-precision compile pathology is gone) and 1 km
  scalability (it ~halves the VRAM arena). It is a pervasive precision change with
  a full identity re-gate — the defined next major lever, not a v0.15 add-on.

## Carried from v0.13.0 (see `docs/KNOWN_ISSUES.md` for full detail)

- **KI-9** — 24 h/72 h forecast-skill equivalence (T2/U10/V10) vs CPU-WRF is the
  credibility gate; v0.14 reports the field-parity gates honestly but does not
  claim closed forecast-skill equivalence. Hard dynamics-`ph'`/MYNN/`*_tendf`
  GPU work, no cheap knob.
- **KI-4** — d02 U10 episodic final-lead under-prediction (tied to KI-9).
- **KI-6** — RRTMG SW intermediate `taug` top-layer convention differs in 4 UV
  bands; integrated fluxes pass tier-1 (< 0.05% rel). Isolated, pre-existing.
- **KI-7** — free-running (`run_boundary=False`) on wide domains (nx≈160+) can go
  unstable beyond ~14 h. The validated operational path uses boundary forcing.
- **KI-10** — moisture-advection cadence refinements (opt-in, default-off; no
  shipped-behavior impact).
- **KI-11** — 2-way nesting equivalence vs CPU-WRF untested (only finite/stable
  proven).
- **KI-5** — powered n=15 TOST is underpowered (n≈27 for full power); scoring
  path is unblocked. No TOST PASS is claimed.
