"""Win #3 numerics-identical proof: async double-buffered writer == sync writer.

Writes the SAME synthetic case via the synchronous ``write_wrfout_netcdf`` and via
``prepare_wrfout_payload`` + ``AsyncWrfoutWriter`` (background thread), then asserts
the resulting wrfout files are byte-for-byte identical. Confirms double-buffering
changes only the wall-clock timing of the NetCDF write, not its content.
