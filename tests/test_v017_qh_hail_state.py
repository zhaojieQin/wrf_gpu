"""v0.17 ADR-032 graupel/hail (qh) State substrate -- structural + inertness gate.

This is the substrate enabler for the hail-heavy microphysics family (WSM7=24,
WDM7=26, UDM=27, Goddard-4ice/NUWRF=7, NSSL=17-22, Thompson-graupel/hail=38).
The schemes themselves are NOT implemented here; these tests assert only that

  * the four leaves ``qh``/``Nh``/``qvolg``/``qvolh`` are appended in the additive
    State tail (append-only; on the v0.18 trunk they sit just before the v0.16
    nwfa/nifa aerosol leaves and the hail_acc accumulator),
  * the flatten/unflatten round-trip is the identity and the treedef is stable,
  * the leaves cold-start at zero and are FP32_GATED (ADR-007),
  * the registry/precision/IO/advection wiring is internally consistent, and
  * the hail MP family stays fail-closed (no scheme is implemented).

No GPU is required: States are built with explicit ``jnp`` arrays. One GPU-gated
check covers ``State.zeros``.
