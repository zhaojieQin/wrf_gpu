"""Proof object for sprint B5 -- namelist recognition breadth.

v0.12.0 honesty contract: a real WRF ``namelist.input`` that selects dynamics/
advection switches, MYNN-EDMF sub-options, gravity-wave drag, physics-cadence
intervals, slope/topo radiation and out-of-scope feature switches must get an
HONEST per-key verdict from :func:`validate_namelist`:

* IMPLEMENTED selections (and operationally-wired control values) pass silently;
* a RECOGNIZED-but-not-operationally-wired control value fails closed with a
  NAMED reason + alternative (never a silent ignore, never a generic error);
* an OUT_OF_SCOPE feature switch fails closed as a named scope decision.

The single source of truth for every per-key verdict is the catalog
(``gpuwrf.io.scheme_catalog``); this test asserts the validator surfaces those
verdicts and -- critically -- that an unsupported-but-recognized key is REJECTED
rather than silently accepted.
