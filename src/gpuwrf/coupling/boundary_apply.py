"""Device-side lateral-boundary forcing for the M6/ADR-023 d02 forecast driver.

This module reproduces the WRF v4 specified + relaxation-zone lateral boundary
update (``spec_bdytend`` / ``relax_bdytend`` in ``share/module_bc.F`` and the
weight table ``lbc_fcx_gcx`` in ``dyn_em/module_bc_em.F``).  Released root/replay
paths retain their post-step ``State -> State`` adapter.  The default-off live
nested bundle instead builds frozen dry/scalar tendencies for the ordinary RK
and acoustic consumers, with no candidate-on post-step prognostic overwrite.

WRF subtleties faithfully reproduced here
------------------------------------------
* **Specified (outer) zone** of width ``spec_zone`` (the outermost row/column,
  ``b_dist=0``) is overwritten with the time-interpolated boundary value
  (WRF ``spec_bdytend`` drives the field tendency toward the boundary value; in
  the side-history replay we set the value directly).
* **Relaxation zone** of width ``relax_zone`` (rows ``b_dist = spec_zone ..
  relax_zone-1``) is nudged by
  ``field += fcx(b_dist)*fls0 - gcx(b_dist)*(fls1+fls2+fls3+fls4-4*fls0)``
  where ``fls0`` is the residual ``bdy - field`` at the row, ``fls1/fls2`` are
  the *tangential* residual neighbours (clamped at the side ends like WRF's
  ``max(i-1,ibs)``/``min(i+1,ibe)``), and ``fls3/fls4`` are the *normal*
  residual neighbours that use the boundary strips at width ``b_dist-1`` and
  ``b_dist+1`` against the adjacent interior rows -- the discrete Laplacian
  smoothing of the boundary residual, exactly as WRF computes it.
* **Corner trimming**: WRF's Y-boundary relaxation runs the tangential index
  ``i`` only over ``[b_limit+ibs , ibe-b_limit]`` with ``b_limit=b_dist`` so the
  diagonal corners are owned by the X (W/E) boundaries; the X-boundary
  relaxation trims its tangential index ``j`` to ``[b_dist+jbs+1 ,
  jbe-b_dist-1]``. We reproduce both via per-row tangential slicing so a
  relaxation-zone cell is updated by exactly one side, matching WRF.
* **Weights** ``fcx``/``gcx`` follow ``lbc_fcx_gcx`` for the
  ``specified``/``nested`` branches (identical linear taper; the optional
  ``spec_exp`` sponge multiplies both). We fold WRF's per-RK ``dt`` factor into
  the weights so a single per-step value update equals one WRF tendency step.

Boundary-record conventions
---------------------------
Released root/replay callers provide decoupled wrfout side-history and retain
their original step-start-mass approximation exactly.  A live nested child with
``nested_frozen_wrf_boundary_bundle`` instead receives the coupled records left
by pristine WRF forcedown: U/V include dry mass and map factors, W includes dry
mass and ``msfty``, and T/PH/scalars include their half/full-level dry mass.
The candidate paths below consume those records directly and never mass-couple
them a second time.

    Reproduces WRF ``calc_p_rho_phi`` (``module_big_step_utilities_em.F``) for
    ``non_hydrostatic=.false., hypsometric_opt==1`` -- the canonical hydrostatic
    pressure / inverse-density / geopotential solve -- and is the EXACT inverse
    of the dycore's nonhydrostatic ``al`` diagnostic (line 1029, used by
    :func:`gpuwrf.dynamics.acoustic_wrf.diagnose_pressure_al_alt`).  Given the
    FORCED column thermodynamics (full ``theta``, ``qv``, perturbation dry mass
    ``mu'``, base dry mass ``mub``, base pressure ``pb``) it returns the
    perturbation geopotential ``ph'`` (faces, ``(nz+1, ny, nx)``) anchored at the
    surface (``ph'[0]=0``) so the total geopotential at the ground equals
    ``phb[0]``.

    Steps (with the pinned-run hybrid coefficients ``c2h==0`` so ``c1h*muts``):
      1. dry hydrostatic pressure ``p`` by downward integration from the lid
         (``:1099-1145``): ``p[top] = -0.5*(c1*mu' + qtot*(c1*muts))/rdnw[top]``,
         ``p[k]   = p[k+1] - (c1*mu' + qtot*(c1*muts))/rdn[k+1]`` with
         ``qtot`` the face-averaged total water (here ``qv`` only, matching the
         single-moisture-species hydrostatic init).
      2. perturbation inverse density from the EOS (``:1115-1142``):
         ``al = (R_d/p0)*theta_full*qvf*((p+pb)/p0)^cvpm - alb``,
         ``alb = (R_d/p0)*t0          *((pb)/p0)^cvpm`` (dry base column),
         ``qvf = 1 + 0.608*qv``.
      3. upward geopotential integration (``:1183-1193``, opt==1):
         ``ph'[k+1] = ph'[k] - dnw[k]*( (c1*muts+c2)*al[k] + c1*mu'*alb[k] )``,
         ``ph'[0]=0``.

    ``dnw`` is the SIGNED eta-face spacing (negative for the normal decreasing
    eta ordering), ``rdnw=1/dnw``, ``rdn`` the mass-level reciprocal spacing,
    matching the dycore metric convention exactly.

#     loops to ``i_start = max(its, ids+spec_zone)`` .. ``i_endu = min(ite,
#     ide-spec_zone)`` (and analogously for v in j), so the OUTERMOST
#     ``spec_zone`` normal face (the domain-edge face, b_dist=0) is NEVER
#     advanced by the acoustic solver.  It is instead driven by
#     ``spec_bdyupdate(u_2, ru_tend, dts_rk, spec_zone)`` (solve_em.F:1346-1364,
#     INSIDE the small_steps DO loop) toward the boundary tendency that
#     ``spec_bdy_dry`` (module_bc_em.F:479-494) wrote into ``ru_tend``/``rv_tend``.
#   * The relaxation zone (b_dist = spec_zone .. relax_zone-1) gets a relaxation
#     tendency folded into ``ru_tend``/``rv_tend`` ONCE per full step at rk_step==1
#     (relax_bdy_dry -> relax_bdytend_core, module_bc.F:1221-1427) computed from
#     the COUPLED momentum residual ``(bdy - ru)``; that tendency is then applied
#     every acoustic substep via ``u_2 += dts*ru_tend`` inside advance_uv.
#
# Our acoustic core advances the COUPLED perturbation work array ``u_work``
# (= ``(mass_ref*u_1 - mass_cur*u_2)/msf``, small_step_prep_wrf), exactly WRF's
# ``grid%u_2``.  So we reproduce both effects directly on the work array:
#   * spec face   : DRIVE ``u_work`` to the work-array boundary target each substep
#                   (equivalent to WRF not advancing it + spec_bdyupdate pinning it
#                   to the boundary value);
#   * relax faces : NUDGE ``u_work`` toward the work-array boundary target with the
#                   relax_bdytend Laplacian stencil, scaled by ``dts`` per substep
#                   (so the per-full-step total matches the WRF tendency once-set,
#                   applied-every-substep behaviour).
#
# The work-array target is the value whose small_step_finish reconstruction equals

# WRF cadence for a SPECIFIED real domain (d01, wrfbdy-driven), from pristine
# solve_em.F / module_bc_em.F / module_bc.F:
#
#   * relax zone (b_dist = spec_zone .. relax_zone-1): ``relax_bdy_dry`` runs
#     ONCE per step at rk_step==1 (solve_em.F:938-965) on the STEP-START fields,
#     adding the Davies tendency (fcx*fls0 - gcx*laplacian, relax_bdytend_core)
#     for the COUPLED ru/rv (couple_momentum), the MASS-WEIGHTED t (c1h/c2h) and
#     ph (c1f/c2f), and the plain 2-D mu.  ``rk_addtend_dry`` folds u/v/t/ph into
#     the step-constant ``*_tendf`` lane consumed at EVERY RK stage; the mu relax
#     goes straight into the stage-1 ``mu_tend`` and is NOT re-added at stages
#     2-3 (rk_tendency zeroes mu_tend each stage -- a WRF quirk we preserve).
#     NO w relax under specified (module_bc_em.F:320-344 is nested-only).
#
#   * spec zone (ring 0): the small-step routines EXCLUDE it; instead
#     ``spec_bdyupdate`` advances u_2/v_2/t_2/mu_2/muts by ``dts*bdy_tend`` every
#     acoustic substep (solve_em.F:1346-1490), ``spec_bdyupdate_ph`` updates the
#     coupled ph_2 (:1587), and ``zero_grad_bdy`` copies the nearest interior w
#     into the ring (:1601-1609, specified only).  Net effect: ring 0 follows the
#     linear-in-time wrfbdy trajectory within the step.  Our in-loop equivalent
#     pins the ring-0 WORK arrays to the value whose small_step_finish
#     reconstruction equals the STAGE-END interpolated leaf (the within-stage
#     linearisation difference is <= dt_stage/cadence of the interval increment,
#     ~0.1% -- second-order against the 200 Pa/stage free-dynamics drift this
#     replaces).
#
#   * end of step: WRF has NO end-of-step dry-field overwrite and NEVER forces
#     the diagnostic p; ``apply_lateral_boundaries(dry_spec_only=True)`` keeps
#     only the ring-0 spec re-sync (idempotent against the in-loop pins) and the
#     full moisture handling, dropping the once-per-step relax-zone value nudge
#     (replaced by the per-stage tendencies above) and the p'/pb forcing.
#
# Released root/replay leaves remain decoupled and therefore use the historical
# step-start mass on both residual operands.  Live-nest candidate leaves are
# coupled before SINT and are consumed in that exact WRF representation.

    Source: WRF ``module_bc_em.F:17-157`` (called solve_em.F:1587 every acoustic
    substep AFTER ``advance_w``).  WRF updates the COUPLED ``ph_2`` in the outer
    ``spec_zone`` row:

      field = field*(c1*mu_old+c2)/(c1*muts+c2)
            + dts*field_tend/(c1*muts+c2)
            + ph_save*((c1*mu_old+c2)/(c1*muts+c2) - 1)

    with ``mu_old = muts - dts*mu_tend``.  Our small-step ``ph`` array is the
    UNCOUPLED perturbation-delta ``ph_work = ph'_ref - ph'`` (small_step_finish
    reconstructs ``ph' = ph_work + ph_save``).  Translating WRF's coupled formula
    to our uncoupled-delta representation: WRF's coupled ``ph_2 = (c1*muts+c2)*ph'``
    so the spec-zone full perturbation geopotential is driven to the boundary leaf
    value (its mass-reweight + tendency form), i.e. ``ph'(spec) -> ph_bdy_leaf``.
    Therefore in the uncoupled-delta space the spec-zone work delta becomes
    ``ph_work(spec) = ph_bdy_leaf - ph_save`` (so that ph_work + ph_save = leaf).

    This is a SINGLE-row hard pin (spec_zone=1), applied to the outermost row only;
    the relaxation zone is owned by the ``ph_tend`` path inside ``advance_w``.  The
    mass-reweight + mu_tend correction terms are O(mu') and ~0 for this fixed-mass
    replay (muts==mut, mu_tend~0), so the leaf-pin is the dominant, WRF-consistent
    effect; we apply the leaf value directly (the exact WRF reweight reduces to it
    when mu_old==muts).  Full-level extent (WRF ``ktf=kte`` for 'h').

    BOTH operands: ``ph_advanced`` (the ``advance_w`` output, kept everywhere

    pre-advance array, the ring walk's base).  Collapsing both onto the

    update and freezes the interior ``ph`` for the whole run (the v0.23.4
    step-200 d03 Ni blocker).  ``ph_tend`` and ``mu_tend`` are the coupled
    record tendencies written by ``spec_bdy_dry``.  The ring equation is the
