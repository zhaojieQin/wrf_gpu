    This is the strict entrypoint the forecast CLI uses. It runs the full
    :func:`validate_namelist` check first (so recognized-but-unimplemented
    schemes, invalid WRF options, mandatory pairings and out-of-scope features
    fail closed exactly as before) AND THEN additionally rejects any selected
    scheme classified ``REFERENCE_ONLY`` by :func:`scheme_catalog.classify_scheme`.

    Why the extra rejection: ``REFERENCE_ONLY`` schemes have oracle-backed
    reference evidence (GREEN where claimed, or an explicitly measured RED gap)
    and so are accepted by :func:`validate_namelist` for a reference /
    single-column comparison or RED oracle-inventory work -- but they are NOT
    wired into the operational GPU scan. Some adapters have no operational scan
    carry-path (MYJ PBL + Janjic Eta surface layer were REFERENCE_ONLY through
    v0.12.0 but are now IMPLEMENTED via the v0.13 traceable pair). Running
    a reference-only scheme through ``gpuwrf run`` would therefore *silently
    substitute a different scheme* or route through a missing kernel, which
    violates the v0.12.0 "no silent wrong path" Scope-A contract. So the
    operational path refuses them loudly, naming the operational scheme the scan
    would actually run and the supported alternative.

    The authoritative IMPLEMENTED-vs-not decision comes from
    :class:`scheme_catalog.SupportStatus`: only ``IMPLEMENTED`` selections run on
    the operational scan; ``REFERENCE_ONLY`` (handled here) and
    ``RECOGNIZED_FAIL_CLOSED`` / ``OUT_OF_SCOPE`` (already rejected by
    :func:`validate_namelist`) all fail closed for an operational run.

    Raises :class:`NotOperationallyWiredError` (a subclass of
    :class:`UnsupportedSchemeError`) when a reference-only scheme is selected;
    re-raises :class:`UnsupportedSchemeError` from the base validation otherwise.
    Does NOT change :func:`validate_namelist`'s acceptance of reference-only
