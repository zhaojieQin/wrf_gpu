"""Machine-readable WRF v4 scheme support catalog -- the public honesty contract.

This module answers, for *every* WRF v4 option of the common physics/dynamics
namelist groups (plus the major feature switches such as WRF-Chem, WRF-Fire,
FDDA, moving nests and stochastic physics), the single question a
WRF developer evaluating this port cares about:

    "If I set this in my namelist, does the GPU port run it, refuse it with a
     named reason, or is it a documented out-of-scope decision?"

Every option resolves to exactly one :class:`SupportStatus`:

* ``IMPLEMENTED``            -- operationally GPU-scan-wired and run normally.
* ``REFERENCE_ONLY``        -- a recognized WRF v4 scheme with an oracle-backed
                               reference path (GREEN parity where claimed, or an
                               explicitly measured RED gap) that is NOT yet
                               wired into the operational GPU scan. It is
                               *accepted* by the namelist validator (so a
                               reference / single-column comparison can be run)
                               but the operational forecast scan fail-closes it
                               loudly with a named reason -- never a silent wrong
                               result.
* ``RECOGNIZED_FAIL_CLOSED``-- a valid WRF v4 option that the port does not
                               implement at all. Selecting it fails closed with a
                               message naming the WRF scheme, the reason, and the
                               supported alternative.
* ``RECOGNIZED_APPROXIMATED``-- a recognized WRF v4 *cadence* control whose
                               requested value the port does not honor exactly,
                               but whose effect is a documented CONSERVATIVE
                               approximation rather than a wrong-scheme
                               substitution: the cumulus/PBL cadence keys
                               (``cudt``/``bldt``) ask the port to sub-step those
                               physics every N minutes, but the GPU port calls
                               them EVERY dynamics step (more frequent than
                               requested). Selecting a positive cadence does NOT
                               fail closed -- the run PROCEEDS and a WARNING names
                               the approximation. This mirrors the operational
                               pipeline, which already runs cumulus/PBL every
                               step regardless of ``cudt``/``bldt``. It is NEVER
                               used for a genuine wrong-substitution (a different
                               scheme / unimplemented advection variant): those
                               stay ``RECOGNIZED_FAIL_CLOSED``.
* ``OUT_OF_SCOPE``          -- a documented design decision NOT to port this
                               capability (coupled chemistry, wildfire, hydrology,
                               moving/vortex-following nests, FDDA/4DVAR
                               nudging, stochastic physics).
                               Selecting it fails closed with the scope decision
                               and the reason.

Honesty rules followed when authoring this catalog (do not relax them):

* ``IMPLEMENTED`` is asserted ONLY for options that are actually threaded into
  the operational GPU scan. The ground truth was read from
  ``runtime.operational_mode._SCAN_WIRED_OPTIONS`` and the adapter registries in
  ``coupling.scan_adapters`` (MP/CU/PBL/SFCLAY), and cross-checked against
  ``contracts.physics_registry`` (the frozen accept-matrix). See
  ``assert_catalog_consistent`` for the machine-checked invariants that keep this
  module from drifting away from those authorities.
* When a scheme has oracle-backed reference evidence but is not operationally
  wired, it is ``REFERENCE_ONLY`` (a caveat), never ``IMPLEMENTED`` (an
  over-claim). The reason must say whether the comparison is GREEN or RED.
* When in doubt about a scheme's support, the safe classification is
  ``RECOGNIZED_FAIL_CLOSED`` (refuse loudly), never ``IMPLEMENTED``.

The full WRF v4 code->name enumeration is owned by
``gpuwrf.io.wrf_scheme_catalog`` (transcribed from ``WRF/run/README.namelist``).
This module classifies each of those codes. Feature-switch keys that have no
integer-enumerated WRF catalog (e.g. ``chem_opt``, ``grid_fdda``, ``ifire``,
``sf_ocean_physics``) are classified directly as ``OUT_OF_SCOPE`` truthy switches.

    """A recognized non-enumerated WRF control key with a wired-value set.

    ``wired`` is the set of values the operational scan actually runs (each is
    classified ``IMPLEMENTED``).  Any other value is ``RECOGNIZED_FAIL_CLOSED``
    with ``unwired_reason`` (a ``str`` or a ``value -> str`` callable) naming why
    the port does not run it, plus ``alternative`` (the wired recipe).
    ``integer`` is False for cadence intervals that may be fractional minutes.

    ``approximated`` marks a control whose unwired values are a documented
    CONSERVATIVE approximation rather than a wrong-substitution: an unwired value
    is classified ``RECOGNIZED_APPROXIMATED`` (a non-raising warning) instead of
    ``RECOGNIZED_FAIL_CLOSED``. This is reserved for the cumulus/PBL cadence keys
    (``cudt``/``bldt``): a positive interval asks the port to sub-step the scheme
    every N minutes, but the GPU port runs it EVERY dynamics step -- more
    frequent than requested, which cannot silently produce a wrong scheme, only a
    slightly more-expensive, more-up-to-date tendency. The run proceeds.
