"""Background wrfout writer (v0.2.0 wall-clock win #3): double-buffered output.

The daily product loop currently blocks the GPU compute loop on the synchronous
NetCDF write of every hour (``execute_daily_pipeline`` -> ``write_wrfout_netcdf``).
The GPT wall-clock analysis (``.agent/reviews/2026-06-01-gpt-wallclock-
optimization.md`` idea #3) measured this synchronous output/CPU work at ~110 s on
the d02 24h path and ~176 s on d03 24h -- all of it serialized in front of the
next forecast hour.

This writer overlaps that work: the main thread eagerly pulls hour N to host
(``prepare_wrfout_payload`` -- a :class:`PreparedWrfout` with NO device refs),
hands it to a SINGLE background thread, and immediately advances the GPU toward
hour N+1. The background thread writes the NetCDF while the GPU computes.

DESIGN / SAFETY
- One worker thread, ``maxsize``-bounded queue (default 2): bounds host RAM and
  guarantees back-pressure if the writer falls behind the GPU.
- A single writer thread => writes are serialized => deterministic file ordering.
  Callers that also read NetCDF during the integration loop must keep those reads
  out of the async window (or use the synchronous fallback), because NetCDF4/HDF5
  builds are not universally safe for concurrent handles across threads.
- The device->host pull happens on the MAIN thread before submit, so the
  background thread never touches a device array that the GPU might reuse.
- The NetCDF bytes are byte-for-byte identical to the synchronous path; only the
  wall-clock timing of the write changes.
- ``join()`` re-raises the first writer error so a failed write still fails the
  run (fail-closed), and must be called before any consumer reads the wrfouts
  (validation/inventory/scoring) or before pipeline exit.
