"""FROZEN shared Noah-MP NamedTuples (ADR-NOAHMP-INTERFACES.md §3).

These are the data boundaries BETWEEN component sprints. They are frozen in
Sprint 0 so S1-S5 can be authored and oracle-tested in parallel without
touching each other's files. Field lists are binding; a component sprint that
needs an extra field must amend this file via the patch protocol, not silently.

All array fields are (ny, nx) on land columns unless noted; fp64; device-resident.
